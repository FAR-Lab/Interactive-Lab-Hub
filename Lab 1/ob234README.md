# Staging Interaction

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

*Setting:* The night light is sitting on the nightstand beside the bed. The alarm is set in the evening to go off in the morning. 

*Players:* The general idea is that the light can be set manually or via Alexa, but I decided to show the Alexa version. 

*Activity:* The subject needs to wake up when the light is at the brightest point. 

*Goals:* The goal is to ensure the subject is awake at the correct time. 

\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*
