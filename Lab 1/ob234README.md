# Staging Interaction

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

*Setting:* The night light is sitting on the nightstand beside the bed. The alarm is set in the evening to go off in the morning. 

*Players:* The general idea is that the light can be set manually or via Alexa, but I decided to show the Alexa version. 

*Activity:* The subject needs to wake up when the light is at the brightest point. 

*Goals:* The goal is to ensure the subject is awake at the correct time. 

\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*



## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
Lighting was a significant factor which impeded the process as I needed to find a balance between showing the cloud while also conveying to the audience that the room is dark. Using basic recording tools (e.g. webcam on laptop) presented a challenge as it was difficult to strike a balance between the appropriate amount of lighting and grainy footage. 

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
Being able to best represent the alarm and convey it to the viewer was definitely a point of focus for the team. The original idea was to have the actor interact with settings manually, however that seemed to be the less streamlined choice. 


## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
I love the concept of being able to control a phone remotely; Although I wish that on the IPhone, there would be a fullscreen option which causes some more work from my end. Otherwise, I can see a lot of practical applications for this!

## Part D. Wizard the device

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*
This is included at the end of the youtube video! 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*
The original prototype and the follow up prototype are shown. Chonky cat for scale.

## Part E. Costume the device

\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

I needed to find something that would hold an iphone - the solo cup didn't work because it was too small, and there was no way to cleanly obscure the light coming from the phone (via cotton 'cloud' medium) as there would be an open space on the top of the light with light shining through, making it less useful. 

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*
