In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell).
 
There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.
 
For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like.
 
_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_
 
 
 
## Prep
 
### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.
 
 
### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!
 
### Deliverables for this lab are:
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.
 
### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Part A. Plan
 
\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*
 
\*\***My idea/concept is for SafteyFirst Phone Case. Utilizing a user’s geolocation, we can help protect the safety of the user by alerting them of nearby collisions when using their mobile devices. There is a common issue in the modern day, where people are so distracted with their devices that when walking they are not alert of their surroundings and can lead to accidents. Whether the accident is walking into nearby pedestrians, walking into oncoming traffic, or any safety hazard. With SF Phone case, we can flash an LED light around the user’s screen to alert the user they should look up. For aesthetics, a user can customize the lighting and colors from either their phone application or desktop and from an entrepreneurship spirit we can also make it a portable charger for dual purpose.**\*\*
 
\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*


 
 
\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*
 
\*\***When brainstorming the idea for SafteyFirst Phone Case, it came to me from my research in my product studio group. Our group's topic is focusing on geolocation/privacy and with that mindset saw nearby students all walking by with headphones on and faces glued to their device screens. I proposed the idea as a mobile application that runs in the user's background that would present a notification or a flashing color on the screen as the alert method. The feedback from my team provided the insight that users may not want the interference with their screen from what they are currently focusing on. With that feedback, I came up with the concept of the phone case to illuminate the border of the phone instead of on-screen notification. **\*\*
 
 
 
## Part B. Act out the Interaction
 
\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
 
\*\***No I do not believe so in this case. The video was similar to the storyboard so it was essentially the same concept essentially.**\*\*
 
\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
 
\*\***No, same as above. The video seemed a bit trivial, however, the brainstorm and feedback was most useful**\*\*
 
 
## Part C. Prototype the device
 
\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
 
\*\***Thought it was a great fun activity to help students get environment setup done properly, as well, provide us with a tangible application we are able to run on our own devices. As a technical person, I loved seeing the actual code to run an application like this, and will love to use this as a backbone for side passion projects for fun.**\*\*
 
 
## Part D. Wizard the device
 
\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*
 
\*\***For the wizarding aspect of the video, I downloaded the app Screen Light Color off the Apple App Store.**\*\*
 
 
## Part E. Costume the device
 
\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***Due to my poor artistic abilities, I thought these images better presented my idea than my hand drawn blueprints. I think I would like the light to be the border of the screen rather than the side of the case.

**\*\*
 
 
\*\***What concerns or opportunities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
\*\***As previously mentioned, the first concept was for an on-screen alert application, but from team feedback there was a possible issue with unwanted screen interference. So I pivoted to the phone case design and that also has possible concerns with battery power. **\*\*
 
 
## Part F. Record
 
\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*
 
\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*

# Staging Interaction, Part 2
 
This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.
 
 
## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)
 
You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear.
 
\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*
 
## Make it your own
 
Do last week’s assignment again, but this time:
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light,
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity.
 
\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
