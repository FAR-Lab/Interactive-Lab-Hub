# Sunlight Alarm Clock
## _An Organic & Relaxing Wakeup Experience_

## Part A. Plan 

1. **Setting:** The setting is the bedroom generally in the morning
1. **Players:** The players involved are the indivudal waking up in the morning. Other individuals may include spouses, partners, roommates, pets, etc. who may also be imapacted by the alarm clock device.
1. **Activity:** The actor is waking up to a visual/light sensored alarm clock rather than an auditory sensored clock.
1. **Goals:** The goal of the player is to wake up peacefully. The goal of any sub-players may be to also wake up peacefully or continue sleeping with little disruption.

#### Peer Feedback Key Points: 

_Combination of feedback recieved from peer review, classmates, and friends_

* "Great idea and use of light for this lab"
* "I wonder how disrupting this alarm would be for someone else in the same bed or in the same room" 
* "I've seen products similar to this and think they're really cool. I wonder if it would actually wake me up though" 
* "Combining light and other senses (sound or vibrations) would be an interesting next step" 

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

I planned out the initial video and acted out the interaction with the sunlight alarm clock prior to filming the video. 

_Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?_ 

_Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?_


## Part C. Prototype the device

I set up the tinkerbelle section of the lab and thought about colors that would be most effective to wake up a person. Perhaps warmer colors that emmulate the sun would be the most 'natural' approach to a sunlight alarm clock, however, the ability for users to customize their own settings would be an interesting configuration as well. Playing around with the tinkerbelle colors also gave me and idea for 'nighttime' settings or perhaps more generla usage of this clock to double as a day time table lamp or nightlight. 

_Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle_

I ran into a couple issues initally setting up tinkerbelle on my macbook, but I was able to successfully troubleshoot theses issues.


## Part D. Wizard the device

#### Initial Video:

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*


## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*


## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
