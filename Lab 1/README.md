# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.



For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. _Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

1. Set up [your Github "Lab Hub" repository](../../../) by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Spring/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to post links to your submissions on your readme.md so we can find them easily.

### For lab, you will need:

1. Paper
1. Markers/ Pen
1. Smart Phone--Main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
1. Computer--we will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls
1. Found objects and materials--you’ll have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other device. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case. Be creative!
1. Scissors

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process.
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction.
1. Submit these in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same for each person in the group.

## The Report
This readme.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done. You can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in the readme.

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

**Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**     

**Setting:** Any location that a carbonated beverage could be agitated.  This specific example will be in an apartment in the evening around dinner time. 

**Players:** An individual looking to consume a carbonated beverage and the carbonated beverage itself.  Can be anyone of any immutable or mutable characteristic and any beverage as long as it is in a sealed container and carbonated. This specific example will be the resident of the apartment with a can of soda.

**Activity:** Measuring the internal pressure of the container to determine if there is risk of spraying the contents on the drinker if opened.  Once the pressure has dropped below a predetermined threshold the device will signal that the beverage is safe to open and drink.

**Goals:** Open a carbonated beverage without worrying if it will explode or not.  Attempt to limit spillage thereby reducing ruined clothing and messy floors among many other annoyances.

Overall this device, in whatever form it may take (ratchet ziptie, air bladder, or other), will meassure internal pressure of a carbonated beverage to determine if it is 'safe' to open.


**Include a picture of your storyboard here**  

An individual is eating dinner goes to get a drink from the fridge and knocks it on the ground.  After this the individual uses the device to see if the pressure is too high and then waits until it lowers to drink the beverage.

**Summarize feedback you got here.**  

The group was mainly concered about how practical and necessary the device is.  There are already so many hyper-specific niche kitchen gadgets that exist is this one really all the necessary.  Furthermore is it not possible just to feel the beverage yourself and slowly open the beverage to let the gas escape.  How often is does this issue really arise that a device is needed for it.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**  

The inital concept was to a ziptie like apparatus with a ratchet to loosen and tighten it.  When physcially trying two issues arose, first being that unless it was really tightened the device would slide down the beverage and could reach a taper and therefore provide inaccuracte readings.  Secondly the weight of the device could tip the drink over compounding the issues as there is no more pressure due to the agitation.

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**      

Instead of being a ziptie the device could be more along the lines of a sleeve that has some form of expanding interior (air or liquid bladder).

## Part C. Prototype the device

**Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**      

Didn't have many issues setting it up. The main issue I had was a large delay between the gong being played on the computer and the phone.  I also had a weird issue that when I opened my laptop later it played the gong again randomly.

## Part D. Wizard the device

**Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**     

Could not embed the video directly as the files are too big so click on the image and an imgur video will play.

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

**Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**     

A ziptie like device that uses a ratchet to secure itself to the beverage to measure pressure.

An airbag like device that inflates a bladder with air or liquid to measure pressure.

**What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**

A simple ziptie while effective can easily break and therefore I have included a second design, which is a bit more robust while at the same time having drawbacks including not being one size fits all.

## Part F. Record

**Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**   

Could not embed the video directly as the files are too big so click on the image and an imgur video will play.

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

**Summarize feedback from your partners here.**      
Perhaps make the device integrated into the beverage can or have a sticker version.  Most advice revolved around making is disposable.

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors, 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

**Document everything here.**
## Part 2 is in addition to the above
## Part A. Plan 

**Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**     

**Setting:** Any location that a carbonated beverage could be agitated and an individual who is bored.. 

**Players:** An individual looking to consume a carbonated beverage and the carbonated beverage itself.  Can be anyone of any immutable or mutable characteristic and any beverage as long as it is in a sealed container and carbonated. This specific example will be the resident of the apartment with a can of soda.

**Activity:** Measuring the internal pressure of the container to determine if there is risk of spraying the contents on the drinker if opened.  Once the pressure has dropped below a predetermined threshold the device will signal that the beverage is safe to open and drink.  Also provides the ability to have the individual play a game of chance by opening the can early through an indication that came too early if so desired (or not explode as it waited the requisite amount of time).

**Goals:** Open a carbonated beverage without worrying if it will explode or not.  Attempt to limit spillage thereby reducing ruined clothing and messy floors among many other annoyances.  Or play a party game with opening the can too early/fool your friends.

Overall this device, in whatever form it may take (ratchet ziptie, air bladder, or other), will meassure internal pressure of a carbonated beverage to determine if it is 'safe' to open.

The addition of a game of chance is to combat the fact that the need to detect beverage can pressure is rather few and far between such that there needs to be alternative uses for the device.  This is where the party game of is the can going to explode comes in.  While one could simply shake the can and open it, they do so knowing it will most likely explode.  By adding the device giving an indication of a go ahead after a random amount of time, this adds an extra layer of chance and fun as well.

The storyboard follows two people at home on the weekend bored.  They decide to play will the beverage explode.  They shake a can of soda, the light goes green, and the can is opened.  It explodes on one of them and they go again.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

There has been some modification to the device, not in terms of hardware, but in terms of software and functionality.  The device now has buttons to actuate the modes of "Start" which is the normal functions and "Lucky" which is the aforementioned game mode.  The device no also vibrates to indicate when safe to drink in normal mode or when some got unlucky in game mode.
