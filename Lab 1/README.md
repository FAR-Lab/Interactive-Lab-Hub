# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.



For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. _Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

1. Set up [your Github "Lab Hub" repository](../../../) by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Spring/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to post links to your submissions on your readme.md so we can find them easily.

### For lab, you will need:

1. Paper
1. Markers/ Pen
1. Smart Phone--Main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
1. Computer--we will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls
1. Found objects and materials--you’ll have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other device. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case. Be creative!
1. Scissors

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process.
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction.
1. Submit these in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same for each person in the group.

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage the interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a jungle, the kitchen) When is it happening?

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? If you reflect on the design of current day interactive devices like the Amazon Alexa, it’s clear they didn’t take into account people who had roommates, or the presence of children. Think through all the people who are in the setting.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.
**Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**
The light device I'm creating is an electric ring that changes colors depending on your stress levels, heart rates, and activity. It collects this information through its connection to a heart rate monitor like a smartwatch. The ring serves the purpose of alerting someone when they begin to feel stressed by changing its color to red, and offers them the awareness to alleviate their high stress levels. A person can take some deep breaths, maybe go for a walk, or understand their rationale better and then return to a normal heart rate which is indicated by a green light. The setting for this device is a bedroom where a student performs many activities like studying, exercising, socializing, and sleeping. There is only 1 player and that is the person wearing the electic ring. 

Sketch a storyboard of the interactions you are planning. It does not need to be perfect, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 
**Include a picture of your storyboard here**

Present your idea to the other people in your breakout room. You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.
**Summarize feedback you got here.**
The feedback I recevied:
1. Keep the light on the ring subtle so that it's not distracting to you - Ritika
2. The electic ring seems like you can wear it anywhere and not just your bedroom. So for the scope of this project, maybe you should call it a table lamp instead because that is stationary and allows you to keep the setting as one spot. - Jeremy



## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**
It felt very awkward to look at the ring and then come to the realization that you are experiencing high stress levels. Are you constantly looking at the ring? Does it buzz to alert you that the color has changed? Do you say "Oh the color is now red" outloud? Do you just think it? 

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**
Yes, I need to figure out if its a gradual transition to the red color, or if it just flashes red once it hits a certain heart rate. And the same question for when it comes back down to yellow and green. I think it's optimal for it to gradually increase, but only 3-4 shades per color, so that it doesn't overwhelm the device. 

## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 
**Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**
The tinkerbelle app worked pretty well for the purposes of this assignment, although I didn't understand the purpose of the two buttons. I just used the first one.

## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

**Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**
I asked my brother to record me from his phone and use my laptop to change the color of the light device. For the light device, I used my phone.

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype.

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

**Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**

**What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**
The device needs to fit on your finger like a ring. It should be a simple and comfortable band, with a little light on the top. The main concern is that it should not be distracting or a nuisance. People's heart rates fluctuate a lot during the day due to digestion, exercise, anger, etc and sometimes its important to manage it, and sometimes its not. So there should be a small on/pause button, perhaps by pressing the light down, so that it doesn't take up extra room on the band. It should also look somewhat stylish bc its important that wearables blend in well to your body and are not protruding.


## Part F. Record

**Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**

**Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**
This idea was inspired by my friend Addie (MBA), who is creating something similar for her studio project. Her project is not light based, it simply records your heartrate and sends meaningful push notifications to your phone.

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

**Summarize feedback from your partners here.**

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors, 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

**Document everything here.**
