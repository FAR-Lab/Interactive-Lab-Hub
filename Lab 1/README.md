# Staging Interaction

\*\***NAME OF COLLABORATORS HERE**\*\*

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage an interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a jungle, the kitchen) When is it happening?

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? If you reflect on the design of current day interactive devices like the Amazon Alexa, it’s clear they didn’t take into account people who had roommates, or the presence of children. Think through all the people who are in the setting.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

Storyboards are a tool for visually exploring a users interaction with a device. They are a fast and cheap method to understand user flow, and iterate on a design before attempting to build on it. Take some time to read through this explanation of [storyboarding in UX design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/storyboarding-ux-design/). Sketch seven storyboards of the interactions you are planning. **It does not need to be perfect**, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 

\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

Present your ideas to the other people in your breakout room (or in small groups). You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*


## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*


## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*


## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*


## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*

## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

Feedback:
1. Lots of effort, it's pretty clear and that's good but it didn't have to be. Liked editing of the video, it's one video instead of several, could explain the activity and role more in the storyboards, but is a pretty strong lab overall.
2. The first two interactions are interesting and novel, and can dig deeper into what kind of treasure it is and explain more of it. For the trash sorter, I think it’s a useful idea I would like to have in real life. In the video, it is easier for people to identify which type of the items are. Awesome idea!
3. I think the trash sorting device is useful when people don’t throw trash according to the trash cans. The way that the trash sorting device is customized could be improved a bit. I would look forward to seeing more storyboards being acted out, especially the Smartplant reader one.

## Part A. Plan

Storyboard 1: Companion Jewelry
* Setting: Bedrooms of two long distance lovers
* Players: Two lovers
* Activity: One person rubs the ring and the other person’s ring lights up and vibrates. You can send each other “heartbeats” 
* Goals: To make their partner feel less alone while apart and communicate nonverbally

![](./img/Untitled_Artwork.jpg)

Storyboard 2: Water Quality Detector
* Setting: Wilderness
* Players: Campers, people not sure about how good the water source they are drinking from
* Activity: Actor puts in the stick of the device to test its quality. The device shows a color and then tells him the best way to purify it. 
* Goals: Drinking clean water 

![](./img/img2.png)

Storyboard 3: Drink Temperature Detector (Spoon)
* Setting:Dining room, cafes 
* Players: People who want to drink coffee, bubble tea or any drink
* Activity: Users put the device into the drink they want to have. The device will indicate the temperature of the drink by changing color. It will also alert the user by sound if the drink is too hot to drink directly.
* Goals: Help users know the temperature of the drink, so the user doesn’t get burnt and knows when to reheat the drink if it is too cold just by looking. 

![](./img/img3.png)

Storyboard 4: Magic Umbrella
* Setting: Sunny days / Rainy Days
* Players: Anyone have this magic umbrella
* Activity:  On sunny days, it indicates the UV level by its color, the higher the UV value, the darker the color of the umbrella to absorb UV rays more effectively. On rainy days, it becomes transparent.
* Goals: Provide convenience for people whether in rainy day or sunny days

![](./img/img4.png)

Storyboard 5: Interactive Shadow Puppet Show
* Setting: Bedroom at bedtime
* Players: Children and caretakers
* Activity: Light scenario changes based on recognition of hand shadow puppet shape and motion (i.e. forming a bird with your hands activates mountain scene and color scheme, eagle sounds from the lamp/projector)
* Goals: Interactive storytelling for children

(No Storyboard)

Storyboard 6: Dog Collar Translator Device
* Setting: Any room in a house with a dog
* Players: A human and a dog
* Activity: A dog feels many things. It may feel hungry, it may feel thirsty, it may want to go on a walk. Depending on the way a dog acts (tries to eat from an empty bowl, tries to drink from an empty bowl, runs at the door, etc) the dog collar will change colors and yell out at the owner what the dog wants.
* Goals: Let the human know what the dog wants.

![](./img/img6.png)

Storyboard 7: Pet feeding reminder
* Setting: Homes of pet owners
* Players: Pet owner, pet
* Activity: The device can detect the amount of food left in the pet’s water and food bowl. It will change to blue if water is running low, and change to yellow if food is running low. It also plays animal sounds (barking for dog, meow for cat) to alert the pet owner. After the owner adds more food, the device will play the voice of the owner, calling the pet to get food.
* Goals: To remind owners to feed pets so pets don’t starve.

![](./img/img7.png)

Storyboard 8: Automatic grocery allocator
* Setting: Kitchen
* Players: People stocking their groceries
* Activity: An actor swipes the item they want to put away and it will tell them where to stock like fridge or pantry or dark space. It will also light red if someone puts an item in the wrong place.
* Goals: To maximize the shelf life of all the groceries

![](./img/img8.png)

**Summarize feedback you got here.**

We went through the ideas among ourselves within our team. For the most part, we all agreed that the ideas were pretty interesting and creative. We all had pretty unique ways of describing how the ideas were to be played out and had some interesting conversations deciding how exactly each scenario would be played out as we had different interpretations from the written descriptions. Overall, we learned that our ideas were viable to continue with. It would be helpful to specify each before moving on though.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**

Interaction 1: The sender won’t know if the receiver got the message.

Interaction 2: Sometimes it’s easier to just not risk it and boil all the water that you have.

Interaction 3: Bringing your own spoon everywhere might be inconvenient.

Interaction 4: Oddly enough it was difficult to try to figure out how to make the umbrella itself change color enough to be noticeable but also not be too much work to actually create. It would have to be some sort of umbrella coverage or maybe some icon to represent the color change without actually changing the umbrella itself.

Interaction 5: It was easier to picture an environment on paper than it is in person.

Interaction 6: The pet could be startled by the color change and the sound, i.e. when the collar is giving false positives when the dog is sleeping. There is also a possibility that depending on the dog’s physiological state, the color of the collar will start changing abruptly. Implementing a cooldown between responses and a gradual color change would be better in practice.

Interaction 7: The location of which the device is placed is important and should be considered carefully. As it needs to be placed in an area where the owner can notice it.

Interaction 8: Having the scanner just display the best possible location and the reason why would be more helpful than the projection onto the real world.

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**


Interaction 1: Having feedback to show that the message was received.

Interaction 2: Having sound feedback that says “Boil”, “Filter”, “Good”.

Interaction 3: Setting your preferred temperature on the spoon.

Interaction 4: Maybe we could include an option to have a manual control over the umbrella when we don’t agree with the umbrella’s assumption.

Interaction 5: If we had the ability to, maybe a future iteration of it could have some background music to match the scene, dramatic music to match if we shadow-puppet a monster (where the scene becomes a castle for example)

Interaction 6: Having a function that makes the collar have “on-demand” translation, which can be activated on the phone.

Interaction 7: Maybe we could have a portable device rather than a static device as the user may not be near the device when alerts go off.

Interaction 8: Names of locations popped up.

## Part C. Prototype the device

**Give us feedback on [Tinkerbelle](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).**

* I wish the “newnewui” branch had more color swatches
* The sounds are really handy!

## Part D. Wizard the device

**Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**
**Show the follow-up work here.**

Our first attempt at setting it up was a successful attempt so it will be included in the final video.

## Part E. Costume the device

**Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**

Device 1: Companion Jewelry

![](./img/img9.png)

Device 2: Drink Temperature Spoon

![](./img/img10.png)

Device 3: Automatic Grocery Allocator

![](./img/img11.png)

**What concerns or opportunities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**

In designing the device aesthetics for the Companion Jewelry, Drink Temperature Detector Spoon, and Automatic Grocery Allocator, a primary influence was the aspiration to enhance portability and convenience. This consideration led to the selection of commonly used objects like jewelry and spoons, ensuring that users can seamlessly integrate these devices into their daily routines. Concurrently, there was a deliberate effort to distinctly differentiate the devices from regular environmental objects to avoid confusion, ensuring they maintain their primary function and user safety while remaining innovative and user-friendly.
