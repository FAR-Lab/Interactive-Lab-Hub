# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.



For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. _Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

1. Set up [your Github "Lab Hub" repository](../../../) by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Spring/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to post links to your submissions on your readme.md so we can find them easily.

### For lab, you will need:

1. Paper
1. Markers/ Pen
1. Smart Phone--Main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
1. Computer--we will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls
1. Found objects and materials--you’ll have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other device. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case. Be creative!
1. Scissors

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process.
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction.
1. Submit these in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same for each person in the group.


## Overview
For this assignment, you are going to 

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)

## The Report
This readme.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done. You can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in the readme.

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

**Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**

The interaction will happen in an kitchen. There will be one user who is trying to cook. They will be using a smartpan with the indicator lights and their goal will be trying to cook a perfect medium rare steak.
 
**Include a picture of your storyboard here**

**Summarize feedback you got here.**

They found this idea interesting. Meanwhile, one classmate asked how will the user find specific recipes and interact with the smart pan. Maybe for this interaction, we also need to implement a touchscreen based panel on the pan, as well as an accompanied mobile app.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**

On paper it looks easy for a user to hold the pan and check the light. However, when we trying to act out, there exist certain angle that the light on the handle might be blocked by the body of user.

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**

One collaborator suggested that maybe instead of a indicator light on the handle of the pan, a light rim on the pan will be cooler and easier to see.

## Part C. Prototype the device

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

**Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**

In general it is a very intuitive and helpful implementation. However, for me it is more light a color panel displayer instead of a light. It might be useful if there exists a slide bar to control the brightness of the color/light.

## Part D. Wizard the device

**Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**



**Show the follow-up work here.**

Instead of putting the phone directly onto the pan handle, I used adhesive tacky putty to savely attach it.

## Part E. Costume the device

**Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**

**What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**

The device could definitely overheat, so I was putting the light on the handle on the prototye. Meanwhile, if the food is overheating, there will be a flashing red light in such emergency setting.

## Part F. Record

**Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**


**Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**

I am being working with Sachi Angle, Antonio Mojena and Sanika Bapat for this lab.

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

**Summarize feedback from your partners here.**

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors, 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

**Document everything here.**
