# Staging Interaction

\*\***Crystal Chong**\*\*

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*
Yifan Yu: I really like the cat your team draw in the story board. The cat looks cute. Also the internal mechanics are particularly detailed and I really like the concept of what you have designed for the internal structure. Your video is very creative, and the cardboard chosen would give us a better idea of the volume size of the product. But I would like to see more interaction between people and product. I also hope that this product will have more features in the future, especially the more practical ones making it more than just a cat with glowing eyes. There also should be some explanation in the video your team provide.

Ben: I liked the device a lot! My only negative comment would be that you didn’t really answer all the questions posed in the prompt. I thought your video was very clear and good. The interaction was well demonstrated.

Gilberto: I really liked the illustrations for your device, the only thing I can say is to reorganize the answers to how the professor wanted

Gloria: I really like your drawings! Your demo video was very cool and I liked how cat eyes changed as different external actions performed. One thing I would suggest is that adding explanations/notes next to your drawings would be very helpful for people to follow :)

Kenneth: I really liked the simple but cute and effective drawings for your storyboard. It was very clear to me what your ideas were for your device. I also liked the video you made for showcasing the device, it was clear and visually effective. It also includes subtitles, which makes things even clearer. The concept was cute and creative, I liked the use of the stuffed elephant to show how an animal can interact with the device :). You could possibly add more features and have some form of human interaction not just with pets and the device. Also for lab1b, I think adding sound such as purring or growling when the pet does certain actions would be very cool.

We got several useful feedbacks, first of all we accidently put the url of our two video in the opposite place, so we fixed that immediatly. We were also advise to use simplier language, readability is more important than being 'professional'. We were also advised to create a preview of our video, We take a look into that real quick. Lastly, We were advice to try to consider add funcationaility of device body reaction and also sound reaction in respons to pets action, to enhance the user experience, that will also be next on our todo list.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Initially, we envisioned our device as a camera-like toy positioned atop the feeding machine, assuming it would effectively capture pet behavior. However, we came to recognize that this approach might limit the device's capabilities and hinder its ability to comprehensively gather the wide spectrum of information pets convey. 

This is especially crucial given that pets predominantly interact with the feeding machine when they're hungry. Our goal is to ensure our bot can gather a diverse array of data to truly grasp and cater to our lonely pets' needs.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

During the implementation phase, a novel concept emerged in response to emergency scenarios, such as break-ins, fires, or floods. We considered the possibility of the device seamlessly transitioning between red and white colors while emitting a warning noise, effectively alerting both occupants and pets within the household to potential dangers.

This innovative addition would significantly enhance the device's utility, expanding its role from a pet companion to a vital safety feature in the home.

## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

There were some issue connecting the device with a public wifi. But was definitly a great tool, we were also able to utilize the sound input box function. Thank you for designing this!!!

## Part D. Wizard the device

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*


## Part E. Costume the device

\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*

Minimalist design:

For a device that seamlessly blends into modern interiors, envision a sleek, compact form resembling a polished stone. Its smooth, rounded edges and matte finish would not only be visually appealing but also practical, preventing overheating concerns.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B192-kjp2.jpg)


Sporty Design:

resembles a resilient rubber ball. This design would be resilient to accidental drops and impacts, and it could incorporate a water-resistant seal to safeguard against potential spills.
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJS_Q1jTh.jpg)


Pet-Friendly Companion Buddy Design:

we craft the device to resemble a small, plush animal friend, akin to a soft toy. The exterior could be covered in a gentle, pet-friendly fabric that's comfortable to touch and cuddle. Incorporate embroidered features like eyes, a nose, and a smiling mouth to give the device a friendly expression. The overall size should be compact and lightweight for easy handling by your pet.

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

Circular Form: The circular shape not only carries a symbolism of continuity and balance but also aligns with our safety considerations. By avoiding sharp corners, we're actively mitigating potential risks associated with accidental collisions involving pets or children. This approach serves to create a safe and understated presence in your home.

Materials: To adhere to the safety guidelines around pets and kids, we'll carefully select materials that are both pet-friendly and child-safe. We'll prioritize non-toxic options that are also durable and easy to clean, given the device's proximity to these important members of your household.

Thoughtful Interactions: We'll discreetly design touch-sensitive areas on the device's surface. These areas will respond to interactions from pets and children, triggering delicate reactions such as subtle vibrations or faint chimes. This approach fosters curiosity and engagement without causing any discomfort.

In this design, our focus is on seamlessly incorporating the circular shape and employing unobtrusive design elements.

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

\*\***NAME OF COLLABORATORS HERE**\*\*
John Li (jl4239), Shiying Wu (sw2298), Mingze Gao (mg2454), Crystal Chong (cc2795), Qianxin(Carl) Gan (qg72), Mingzhe Sun (ms3636)


## Part A. Plan 
**_Setting:_** The interaction takes place in a kitchen, where the device is typically affixed to the refrigerator door, though it is also detachable. The interaction initiates when a user stands within the range where the device can detect their presence. The interaction can be triggered through either touch or voice commands.

**_Players:_** Anyone standing in front of the device can interact with it. Voice commands are not tied to specific users; in other words, anyone saying the keyword 'Hi, <device\>' can activate it.

**_Activity:_** 7 different activities are provided by the device:

**1. Dietary Guardian:** This device scans the food items provided by the user and assesses whether this combination is healthy or not, taking into account the user's health records, dietary restrictions, and current medications. It conveys this information through a color-coded system: red for unsafe and green for safe. Additionally, it provides further details through both audio and text projected onto the fridge.

**2. Food Compatibility Advisor:** When the user is uncertain about a specific food combination, they can invoke the device through an audio command, and the device will respond with a color-coded system: red for unsafe and green for safe. Furthermore, it provides additional details through both audio and text projected onto the fridge.

**3. Ingredient Checker:** Upload your grocery shopping list from your phone or let the device scan the receipt, allowing our system to check for potential food safety concerns before your purchase. Additionally, it will remind you of items already in the fridge, displaying their last purchase date to prevent duplicate purchases.

**4. Interactive Educational Helper:** Users can engage with the device in quiz mode to test their knowledge of food combinations.

**5. Fridge Inventory Condition Checker:** When the user brings in new groceries, they can activate the grocery loading mode to monitor the freshness of their food. As items are placed in the fridge, the device identifies them, verbally confirming the food name and storage date with the user. If the device detects that the food is likely spoiled, it turns red and emits a warning sound to alert the user when they approach the fridge.

**6. Drink & Beverage Tracker:** For bartenders, keeping tabs on drink and beverage inventory is essential to avoid running out of supplies. Each time the user adds a new drink to the fridge, the device updates the inventory count accordingly. Users can also set a minimum threshold for each drink while loading them into the fridge. If the quantity of a drink falls below the set threshold, the device turns red and emits a warning sound.

**7. Monsieur le Chef:** Stumped about dinner options? This device suggests potential meals based on your current fridge inventory and provides recipes to help you decide.


**_Goals:_** The goal of the player is to maintain a healthy diet.

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

Overall, the feedback for our design concepts is very positive: our design concepts are well-thought-out and offer a variety of functionalities aimed at different needs and scenarios. At the same time, we were advised to use simpler language, as readability is also a key factor in addition to professionalism for our design. One of the suggestions is to provide users with a guide to what they can expect from the product. Lastly, We were advised to consider enhancing user experience by adding more feedback in addition to light. For example, we can incorporate sound cues and vibrations into our design to facilitate the users. In addition, it is possible to empower Learning Algorithms in the device that interfaces with a Smart Phone Application. This application holds the capability to assist the device in sending timely reminders and facilitating orders initiated by the user. It could also use data from the household to provide more personalized advice and further optimize the user experience.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 


\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
At first, we plan to use text to display all the information needed by the user. However, when we acted out displaying text on screen, we figured that text is not intuitive and hard for people to read on such a device. Therefore, we started to think about more interactive ways of showing that information by using light and voice. This finding guides our future design of the device.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
We realized that since the device is designed to be a food advisor, it should also have the capability to provide food recommendations. With this idea in mind, we expanded the device's functionality to turn it into an at-home chef and nutritionist.

## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
The user experience of Tinkerbelle is user-friendly and trouble-free. It could be improved if additional functionalities could be incorporated. For instance, while using the phone as a lighting tool, a full-screen mode that exclusively showcases the color without any buttons would be desirable. In addition, adding the feature that users can manually input RGB numbers can increase the flexibility of Tinkerbelle. 


## Part D. Wizard the device

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*
[<img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H11LzyNA3.png">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdZUB5HhaLk&ab_channel=AllenSun)

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*
See part F for details.


## Part E. Costume the device 

\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*

Minimalism Design

Our first design is a coin-sized, portable device designed for effortless convenience. This tiny attachment seamlessly affixes to your phone, you can carry this device around and make evaluation of the food.
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkwmD2XRn.jpg)

Wearable Design

Our second design is a sleek, glass-like device that instantly scans food, analyzing its nutritional quality, freshness, and safety. It then illuminates the results in vibrant colors, making it effortless to distinguish between good and bad food choices, ensuring your health and well-being with just a glance.
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rySJDhX0n.jpg)

Seamlessly Household Design

Our third is a fridge-sticker-sized smart device that blends into your kitchen. It identifies the quality of the food in your fridge, categorizing it as fresh, near expiry, or spoiled, and offers personalized meal suggestions based on what's available. It's like having a nutritionist right in your kitchen, ensuring you make the best food choices while minimizing waste.
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SysRLnQ03.jpg)

\*\***What concerns or opportunities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

By designing the device, a few concerns might influence the way to design our product. Firstly, the device can be carried to different places; therefore, accessibility and flexibility have to be carefully considered. The design of the device should be simple and portable. Secondly, the size of the product needs to be very reasonable to adapt to every situation. For example, we have designed three different formats of the product to provide alternative ways of accessing the device.
