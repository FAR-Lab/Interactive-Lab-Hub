# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.



For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. _Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

1. Set up [your Github "Lab Hub" repository](../../../) by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Spring/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to post links to your submissions on your readme.md so we can find them easily.

### For lab, you will need:

1. Paper
1. Markers/ Pen
1. Smart Phone--Main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
1. Computer--we will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls
1. Found objects and materials--you’ll have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other device. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case. Be creative!
1. Scissors

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process.
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction.
1. Submit these in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same for each person in the group.


## Overview
For this assignment, you are going to 

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)

## The Report
This readme.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done. You can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in the readme.

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

The device I am thinking of is a wearable sensor that detects the stress level and gives out warning when the stress level goes above a certain threshold. It’s mainly for people who work under stressful circumstance a lot or for people who are trying to better understand and manage their emotions. For instance, students and professionals. This is also an easy version of my product/startup studio idea.

When the player is relaxed, the stress level is low and the wristband would show the green light. Then that person starts performing a stressful task like finishing an assignment close to the deadline, the wristband can senor the increase in the pulse as the indicator of the increase in stress level. The wristband then changes the color to yellow and vibrates slightly. Right before the deadline, the player gets really stressed out. The wristband turns to red, vibrates intensively and gives out “BEEP BEEP” alert sound as a serious warning.

Feedback:
        The person’s face and neck look separate from the hand, so it’s hard to tell if it’s the same person.
         Hard to tell that the person is doing an assignment from the second picture and the laptop looks like an alarm.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

By acting out, the process doesn’t look that ideal as what I pictured in the storyboard.
There is no new idea coming up.


## Part C. Prototype the device

It’s really cool to play around with Tinkerbelle. In the first try, I ran into error opening http://localhost:5000 using my apartment wifi. In the second try, I wasn’t able to open the browser on my phone. Later on, the issue got resolved when I switched to the campus wifi.

## Part D. Wizard the device
Video link: https://kapwi.ng/c/OQHQq8Vo
In the first attempt, the player just acted out without saying anything, so it was kind of confusing. Also, the “Beep Beep” alarm sound didn’t work when I clicked it along with the red light. Therefore, in the following attempts, the player speaks out a little bit more about what she is doing and added more emotional expression to the action, which makes the quality of the video becomes better.

## Part E. Costume the device

The potential designs are listed above. They are all wearable sensors similar to jewelry that are easy to put on and detach. Wristband and ring are the better options I think because the rest of the other options are harder to detect the lights and less subtle to the users. The pulse detection is more accurate on the wrist and the earloop so wristband and earring are more accurate at capturing and signaling the stress level.

## Part F. Record

Rui, Irene, Hortense and Brandt helped me set up my github and gave me feedback in the lab.

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

I received good feedback from my group in general. Hortense and Irene mentioned the privacy issue of the device that the device can be more informative and private. Therefore, ring can be a potentially better option. I was mainly targeting on the adult group when I first designed it. Hortense suggested that there is a potential use for infants or non-verbal children, which can help their parents know how to take care of them. Brandt also pointed out that the baseline should be modifiable and adjustable to a personal level and I totally agree.
## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors, 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

**Document everything here.**
