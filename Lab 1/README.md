# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage an interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a jungle, the kitchen) When is it happening?

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? If you reflect on the design of current day interactive devices like the Amazon Alexa, it’s clear they didn’t take into account people who had roommates, or the presence of children. Think through all the people who are in the setting.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.

Setting: Study area where people are doing work either together or apart

Players: Students

Activity: getting work/school work done

Goals: to be reminded to take consistent breaks every 30 minutes when working to increase productivity

Storyboards are a tool for visually exploring a users interaction with a device. They are a fast and cheap method to understand user flow, and iterate on a design before attempting to build on it. Take some time to read through this explanation of [storyboarding in UX design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/storyboarding-ux-design/). Sketch seven storyboards of the interactions you are planning. **It does not need to be perfect**, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 

![interactive device lab 1 storyboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112091818/186923295-9a5bc749-7211-4da3-929c-d367725f44e1.jpg)
*The final device does not need to be in the shape of a dino. I just thought it would be cute for the storyboard

Present your ideas to the other people in your breakout room (or in small groups). You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.

Interesting idea, not sure if it will create the desired affect especially because it doesn't force students to study
Said my dino was cute


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

Simply having the light wasn't enough when I wasn't actively paying attention to the light.

Adding a sound/buzzing component so I don't miss the change would be good to do


## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

Tinkerbelle worked great for me :)

## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

[\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*](https://cornell.zoom.us/rec/share/JVh665V_ipHyQARxO8kyWotXBf9Q8nO4Vy6-DFOmkPlWdRFaM-nSez53g_GdRsGU.onefTW7i3pzXJNBa?startTime=1661818884000)

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 


## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

My device shouldn't be too big as too not take up too much space. 


The first is the sleek design to keep the device low key. 

The second was made to be cute as to entice people to interact with the device more openly. 

The third was to meet some middle ground where it is 3D like the second design but less loud similar to the first design. 


## Part F. Record

[\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*](https://cornell.zoom.us/rec/share/JVh665V_ipHyQARxO8kyWotXBf9Q8nO4Vy6-DFOmkPlWdRFaM-nSez53g_GdRsGU.onefTW7i3pzXJNBa?startTime=1661818884000)

I got some design inspiration from my night lamp which looks like a little creature. 
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

Good job Sara! I think this project is a good reminder for people to take a breath and get up to walk around. My suggestions to take it further are:

1. Maybe add a feature or two to it to make it a little more robust? For instance, maybe it could play relaxing music to help people de-stress when they are working from within the confines of a private place. 

2. You could make it so that it can serve as a table light, and/or work with smart home devices so it can help you keep at your work no matter what part of your house needs adjusting.

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

1. Device that changes color and plays soothing music to keep the user focused
2. Device that changes color and says to "start", "get ready to stop" and "take a break"
3. A light source that decreases in brightness to encourage a break periodically
4. Device that wakes up a sleeping user by buzzing and ringing, plays peaceful music once awake
5. Device that keeps the user seated and working by yelling and turning pink until user comes back
6. Device that shows time and lets the user know when they should be getting to bed using color and commands
7. Same device as #1 however during break time, plays awesome music to encourage user to dance

Some of the louder devices may be distracting for workers nearby. In addition, may be a little scary to work with (watch video to understand)
