## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

Feedback:
1. Lots of effort, it's pretty clear and that's good but it didn't have to be. Liked editing of the video, it's one video instead of several, could explain the activity and role more in the storyboards, but is a pretty strong lab overall.
2. The first two interactions are interesting and novel, and can dig deeper into what kind of treasure it is and explain more of it. For the trash sorter, I think it’s a useful idea I would like to have in real life. In the video, it is easier for people to identify which type of the items are. Awesome idea!
3. I think the trash sorting device is useful when people don’t throw trash according to the trash cans. The way that the trash sorting device is customized could be improved a bit. I would look forward to seeing more storyboards being acted out, especially the Smartplant reader one. 

## Make it your own

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*

## Part A. Plan

Storyboard 1: Companion Jewelry
* Setting: Bedrooms of two long distance lovers
* Players: Two lovers
* Activity: One person rubs the ring and the other person’s ring lights up and vibrates. You can send each other “heartbeats” 
* Goals: To make their partner feel less alone while apart and communicate nonverbally

Storyboard 2: Water Quality Detector
* Setting: Wilderness
* Players: Campers, people not sure about how good the water source they are drinking from
* Activity: Actor puts in the stick of the device to test its quality. The device shows a color and then tells him the best way to purify it. 
* Goals: Drinking clean water

Storyboard 3: Drink Temperature Detector (Spoon)
* Setting:Dining room, cafes 
* Players: People who want to drink coffee, bubble tea or any drink
* Activity: Users put the device into the drink they want to have. The device will indicate the temperature of the drink by changing color. It will also alert the user by sound if the drink is too hot to drink directly.
* Goals: Help users know the temperature of the drink, so the user doesn’t get burnt and knows when to reheat the drink if it is too cold just by looking.

Storyboard 4: Magic Umbrella
* Setting: Sunny days / Rainy Days
* Players: Anyone have this magic umbrella
* Activity:  On sunny days, it indicates the UV level by its color, the higher the UV value, the darker the color of the umbrella to absorb UV rays more effectively. On rainy days, it becomes transparent.
* Goals: Provide convenience for people whether in rainy day or sunny days

Storyboard 5: Interactive Shadow Puppet Show
* Setting: Bedroom at bedtime
* Players: Children and caretakers
* Activity: Light scenario changes based on recognition of hand shadow puppet shape and motion (i.e. forming a bird with your hands activates mountain scene and color scheme, eagle sounds from the lamp/projector)
* Goals: Interactive storytelling for children

(No Storyboard)

Storyboard 6: Dog Collar Translator Device
* Setting: Any room in a house with a dog
* Players: A human and a dog
* Activity: A dog feels many things. It may feel hungry, it may feel thirsty, it may want to go on a walk. Depending on the way a dog acts (tries to eat from an empty bowl, tries to drink from an empty bowl, runs at the door, etc) the dog collar will change colors and yell out at the owner what the dog wants.
* Goals: Let the human know what the dog wants.

Storyboard 7: Pet feeding reminder
* Setting: Homes of pet owners
* Players: Pet owner, pet
* Activity: The device can detect the amount of food left in the pet’s water and food bowl. It will change to blue if water is running low, and change to yellow if food is running low. It also plays animal sounds (barking for dog, meow for cat) to alert the pet owner. After the owner adds more food, the device will play the voice of the owner, calling the pet to get food.
* Goals: To remind owners to feed pets so pets don’t starve.

Storyboard 8: Automatic grocery allocator
* Setting: Kitchen
* Players: People stocking their groceries
* Activity: An actor swipes the item they want to put away and it will tell them where to stock like fridge or pantry or dark space. It will also light red if someone puts an item in the wrong place.
* Goals: To maximize the shelf life of all the groceries

**Summarize feedback you got here.**

We went through the ideas among ourselves within our team. For the most part, we all agreed that the ideas were pretty interesting and creative. We all had pretty unique ways of describing how the ideas were to be played out and had some interesting conversations deciding how exactly each scenario would be played out as we had different interpretations from the written descriptions. Overall, we learned that our ideas were viable to continue with. It would be helpful to specify each before moving on though.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**

Interaction 1: The sender won’t know if the receiver got the message.

Interaction 2: Sometimes it’s easier to just not risk it and boil all the water that you have.

Interaction 3: Bringing your own spoon everywhere might be inconvenient.

Interaction 4: Oddly enough it was difficult to try to figure out how to make the umbrella itself change color enough to be noticeable but also not be too much work to actually create. It would have to be some sort of umbrella coverage or maybe some icon to represent the color change without actually changing the umbrella itself.

Interaction 5: It was easier to picture an environment on paper than it is in person.

Interaction 6: The pet could be startled by the color change and the sound, i.e. when the collar is giving false positives when the dog is sleeping. There is also a possibility that depending on the dog’s physiological state, the color of the collar will start changing abruptly. Implementing a cooldown between responses and a gradual color change would be better in practice.

Interaction 7: The location of which the device is placed is important and should be considered carefully. As it needs to be placed in an area where the owner can notice it.

Interaction 8: Having the scanner just display the best possible location and the reason why would be more helpful than the projection onto the real world.

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**


Interaction 1: Having feedback to show that the message was received.

Interaction 2: Having sound feedback that says “Boil”, “Filter”, “Good”.

Interaction 3: Setting your preferred temperature on the spoon.

Interaction 4: Maybe we could include an option to have a manual control over the umbrella when we don’t agree with the umbrella’s assumption.

Interaction 5: If we had the ability to, maybe a future iteration of it could have some background music to match the scene, dramatic music to match if we shadow-puppet a monster (where the scene becomes a castle for example)

Interaction 6: Having a function that makes the collar have “on-demand” translation, which can be activated on the phone.

Interaction 7: Maybe we could have a portable device rather than a static device as the user may not be near the device when alerts go off.

Interaction 8: Names of locations popped up.

## Part C. Prototype the device

**Give us feedback on [Tinkerbelle](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).**

* I wish the “newnewui” branch had more color swatches
* The sounds are really handy!

## Part D. Wizard the device

**Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**
**Show the follow-up work here.**

Our first attempt at setting it up was a successful attempt so it will be included in the final video.

## Part E. Costume the device

**Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**

Device 1: Companion Jewelry

Device 2: Drink Temperature Spoon

![](./img/img10.png)

Device 3: Automatic Grocery Allocator

![](./img/img11.png)

**What concerns or opportunities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**

In designing the device aesthetics for the Companion Jewelry, Drink Temperature Detector Spoon, and Automatic Grocery Allocator, a primary influence was the aspiration to enhance portability and convenience. This consideration led to the selection of commonly used objects like jewelry and spoons, ensuring that users can seamlessly integrate these devices into their daily routines. Concurrently, there was a deliberate effort to distinctly differentiate the devices from regular environmental objects to avoid confusion, ensuring they maintain their primary function and user safety while remaining innovative and user-friendly.

## Part F. Record
