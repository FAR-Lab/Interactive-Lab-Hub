# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.



For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. _Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

1. Set up [your Github "Lab Hub" repository](../../../) by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Spring/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to post links to your submissions on your readme.md so we can find them easily.

### For lab, you will need:

1. Paper
1. Markers/ Pen
1. Smart Phone--Main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
1. Computer--we will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls
1. Found objects and materials--you’ll have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other device. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case. Be creative!
1. Scissors

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process.
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction.
1. Submit these in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same for each person in the group.

## Part A. Plan 

The device I am thinking of is a wearable sensor that detects the stress level and gives out warning when the stress level goes above a certain threshold. It’s mainly for people who work under stressful circumstance a lot or for people who are trying to better understand and manage their emotions. For instance, students and professionals. This is also an easy version of my product/startup studio idea.

When the player is relaxed, the stress level is low and the wristband would show the green light. Then that person starts performing a stressful task like finishing an assignment close to the deadline, the wristband can senor the increase in the pulse as the indicator of the increase in stress level. The wristband then changes the color to yellow and vibrates slightly. Right before the deadline, the player gets really stressed out. The wristband turns to red, vibrates intensively and gives out “BEEP BEEP” alert sound as a serious warning.

Feedback:
        The person’s face and neck look separate from the hand, so it’s hard to tell if it’s the same person.
         Hard to tell that the person is doing an assignment from the second picture and the laptop looks like an alarm.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

By acting out, the process doesn’t look that ideal as what I pictured in the storyboard.
There is no new idea coming up.


## Part C. Prototype the device

It’s really cool to play around with Tinkerbelle. In the first try, I ran into error opening http://localhost:5000 using my apartment wifi. In the second try, I wasn’t able to open the browser on my phone. Later on, the issue got resolved when I switched to the campus wifi.

## Part D. Wizard the device
Video link: https://kapwi.ng/c/OQHQq8Vo
In the first attempt, the player just acted out without saying anything, so it was kind of confusing. Also, the “Beep Beep” alarm sound didn’t work when I clicked it along with the red light. Therefore, in the following attempts, the player speaks out a little bit more about what she is doing and added more emotional expression to the action, which makes the quality of the video becomes better.

## Part E. Costume the device
![alt text](https://github.com/nicole-zy/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%201/image.png)

The potential designs are listed above. They are all wearable sensors similar to jewelry that are easy to put on and detach. Wristband and ring are the better options I think because the rest of the other options are harder to detect the lights and less subtle to the users. The pulse detection is more accurate on the wrist and the earloop so wristband and earring are more accurate at capturing and signaling the stress level.

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)
Irene: “I need this! How about a ring? On one hand is cool that you can see that you are stressed and able to control this feeling (maybe with some meditation?) but on the other side, I would not like people next to me to see that I am stressed. How can we make this device informative but a bit more private?”

Hortense: “This kind of feels like an electronic mood ring! I think the best format for it would be a wearable that can be easily hidden (for privacy purposes) and is easy to check, like a watch. Earings and anklets are harder for you to check, so it might not be as practical. Another thing to think about is wether this could be used for children as well -- maybe it could be used to detect distress in infants or non-verbal children, so their caretaker can help them before they start crying or having a fit.”

Brandt: “This is definitely something I would use although I’m not sure how much heed I would pay it considering the fact I feel like it would be a constant shade of red for me.  On that point is there any way to allow the user to modify the granularity of the device and to change the baseline?  I feel that would be helpful for those who are looking for relative changes on a finer level rather than just absolute metrics based off some predetermined global baseline.”

Rui: “Your story board is really good! I also like your video haha. I think the idea is good but am worried that if the user is alerted that they are experiencing a stress response that it would make them even more stressed. What if instead of playing a blaring alarm with a red color to notify the user that they are stressed you instead have a blue color and soothing music to make the user less stressed when they see it.”

## Make it your own
After receiving the feedback from my group, many mentioned the privacy issue of the device that the users don’t want other people besides themselves to know how stressed they are. The device can be made more private and more informative. Therefore, I changed the device to be wearable on the fingers similar to the ring and I got rid of the sound and light functionality on the device and made it be vibration only. 
![alt text](https://github.com/nicole-zy/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%201/IMG_0644.jpg)

I drew a new storyboard. The ring is remotely connected to an accompanying app on the user’s phone that allowing the user to set the threshold of different stress level himself. At 9 pm, the user feels relaxed, the ring detects the heart pulse of the user to be stable and the ring sends feedback to the app. The app shows the green light. At 11:58 pm, the user is working on an assignment close to the deadline and he is working under a lot of pressure. The ring starts to vibrate slightly as an early warning and the app changes to the yellow light. At 11:59 pm when the assignment is due, the user is really stressed out, the ring vibrates vigorously for about 10 seconds, and the apps changes to a red light and gives a short “BEEP BEEP” sound. After knowing the user is stressed, the app plays soft music to comfort the user. Then, the user starts to calm down, the light on the app changes from red to yellow and to green when the user’s stressed level gets very low again.

Feeedback:
The app can do more than just informing the user. For example, giving suggestions and feedback to help the user better manage his emotions.


Prototype (Device):
![alt text](https://github.com/nicole-zy/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%201/IMG_0646.jpg)
I come up with 2 designs of the prototype. The first one is a wristband and the second one is a ring. Moreover, the design can be as comfortable as a piece of Jewelry, so I added a more elaborated designer brand version.

Prototype (App):
![alt text](https://github.com/nicole-zy/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%201/IMG_0647.jpg)
For the accompanying app, I draw two versions to display the stress level (Green- low stress level, yellow - medium stress level, red – high stress level). Version 1 uses the face to indicate how user feels, which I think is more user friendly. Version 2 is more informative, showing the score of how well the user feels.

The video I created is here https://kapwi.ng/c/lelSOODK.

Rui, Brandt, Hortense, Irene and Brian gave me very useful feedback and helped me to improve my design.
An especial thank to Mehma Bhasin for helping me record the video.
