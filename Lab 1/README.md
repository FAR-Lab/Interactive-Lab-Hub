## Lab Overview

For this assignment, I have the following parts:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)


## Part A. Plan 

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

Setting: The interaction is happing in residential housing settings, specifically right on top or beside the hallway light switch by the door to outside that people will turn off during leaving the house. A light will signal the outside temperature with colors ranging from red (represents warm) to blue (represents cold) relavant to current season.

Players: The player involved in the interaction is the resident in the household that currently planning to leave the house and the light switch.

Activity: When the user/resident plans to leave the house and turn off the light by the front door (usually hallway light and the last light to turn off when leaving), the device will be connected to the light switch and then signals the outside temperature today with a color scale from dark red to dark blue.

Goals: The goal of this design is to actively share weather information with resident who is intended to leave the house to the outside. It can remind people of wearing more or less cloth when adjusting the temperature outside.

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

**Story Board:**

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

**Feedback:**

1) Not every user who turn off the light is for leaving the house.

2) If leave the house in morning, might not need to go through the turn off light action.

3) Even if noticed, would be extra work to return to bedroom and get cloth or remove cloth.


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

**Acting Result:**

The action feels smoother than I expected, and the association with switch connects the behavior of "exiting" with what's the temperature is going to be like outside, which is intuitive and easy to understand the association. However, as the feedback suggests, it does feel less useful due to the fact that if I want to change cloth I'd have to go back. Also, just like roommate noise in Alexa, people might have different reasons to turn on or off the light (though the information doesn't hurt, it do feels not efficient enough).

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

**New Ideas:**

Due to the acting experience, I decided to change the settings and the interaction method. The temperature light will now be placed in the bedroom/dressing room setting, specifically by the mirror, which people mostly visit only when dressing up or changing cloth. The temperature light will now be associated with a motion detector that detect whether there is a person standing in front of the mirror. If a person does, it will then display the color associated with the temperature from red to blue (warm to cold) with respect to current season (delivering the idea that whether warmer than normal or colder than normal). In that case, user will be directly getting the information during changing clothes, also the information will be automtically delivered when using the mirror instead of associated with a switch.


## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

Tinkerbelle is a brilliant design! The only problem I experienced is that its color is categorical in transition, so I cannot make a smooth transition from blue to red (if I want to skip purple).


## Part D. Wizard the device

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

**First SetUp:**

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

## Part E. Costume the device

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

I want the design to be as thin, as close to the thickness of a mirror as possible, so it can asthetically fit in the bedroom design. Also I designed it to be powered by button battery so it can be portable and physically space saving. If in future designs the information deliver system involves more than just lights, than it can also be using a LED or OLED screen to provide more weather information and even other relavant information in the same design.


## Part F. Record

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Feedback

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

Nice job. I love the mirror integration and location choice for where you're choosing your clothes. Keeping tech hyper relevant to the situation without having to grab your phone would save time. I usually go scrambling for my phone when getting dressed to check the weather!

What I wish it had was a suggestion like "light jacket" or "heavy jacket" based on weather. Sometimes I am unsure what to grab, even knowing the temperature. Great job!!

This is a very useful innovation that I actually may need in daily life. It's especially considerate to put the device in the bedroom next to a mirror, where most people change outfits. The only critical feedback I can think of is that maybe you can also add in features to indicates humidity/raining/snow/wind etc. Because sometimes under different weather condition, temperature may not be the only thing that determines what to wear for the day.

**Summary:**

1) Cloth Suggestions may be applied based on weather information
2) Not only just warm/cold, but also other type of weather information like rain/snow/humidit


## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*


### New Idea Description

After evaluating the feedback and act in a series of new interactions, I decided to expand the device in terms of both receiving information and delivering information (also interaction with human users). 

Instead of just using a range of light to indicate relative temperature outside, now it's no longer limited to deliver information through light, but through a LED screen that could provide more information through a more user-friendly interface. Other than just a motion detector that associated with detection of human standing in front of the mirror, now it also has a camera or actually can be replaced by a single camera with multiple purposes (motion detection, hand-gesture recognition, and cloth recognition).

The device now provides a more detailed weather information with not only just colors for temperatures, but also rain status, extreme weather conditions, sunlight degrees, and humidity. Other than original designed weather information, the device can now also provide cloths suggestions in a modern and personalized way. The feedback from my fellow classmates and my friends shares a common thought that people do not know what to wear even with the weather information known sometimes. Also it's common for people not to check the weather & temperature intentionally on the phone if they are in a hurry when dressing up, or just don't want to spend an extra effort on taking the phone out of pocket while hold clothes in hands. Thus, in this novel version of the device, people can stand in front of the mirror to active the device through motion as before, then they will receive detailed weather information in the main screen. Then, if they use hand gesture to swipe to the right, they can see cloth suggestions based on current weather.
 
The cloth suggestion firstly gives out some common combinations of cloth to wear at this temperature, then it can provide feedback on whether what the user is wearing right now is too warm or too cold based on computer vision analysis of their current cloths. 

The reason why switching between different information displayed on the screen is using hand gestures instead of touching is that this device is attached to, or even as a part of a mirror. When it's turned off, it should be look like just a mirror itself. People are natually more resistant to touch or lay hand on a mirror, besides, touching requires a close distance with the device, while when people are changing clothes, they are generally at a medium distance with the mirror to get a full picture of oneself.

Some future ideas that can be derived from this device is connected to other part of human life. For example, a mobile app developed associate with the device to provide more personalized cloth suggestion. If the user would like to take a picture of every cloth they have, the device will be able to provide combinations of clothes every morning for users to choose what fits their mood, which makes the hard choice that most people face every morning way easier.
