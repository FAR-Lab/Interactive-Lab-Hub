# Staging Interaction

**Amber Tsao (ct649), Julia Lin(jtl236), Sherri Lin (yl3658), Wayne Cheng (cc2796), Yifeng Wu (iw84)**

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage an interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a jungle, the kitchen) When is it happening?

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? If you reflect on the design of current day interactive devices like the Amazon Alexa, it’s clear they didn’t take into account people who had roommates, or the presence of children. Think through all the people who are in the setting.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

---

_Setting:_ The kitchen when people are trying to heat food in the microwave oven

_Players:_ People in the household who are using the microwave

_Activity 1:_ Mom is trying to use the microwave to reheat last night's leftovers and she is wondering if she can simply use the container that the food was already in to reheat the food. She puts the leftovers in its original container and puts it in the microwave. The microwave that she uses will automatically detect whether the container is microwavable and its internal light will turn red if it is not microwavable. Examples of materials that are not microwavable include plastic, metals, and paper. 

_Activity 2:_ Dad is trying to reheat leftover food and he wants to know if his food has been fully heated. Instead of having to take his food out and try it to see if it has been fully heated, once he opens the microwave the light will be displayed in blue. From that he is able to see that his food hasn't been fully heated and he can heat it again.

_Activity 3:_ Mom wants to reheat a bowl of soup using the microwave but the soup spills out onto the turn table of the microwave. The microwave then detects the spillage of soup and automatically stops. The light on the outside of the microwave also starts flashing. Now mom is able to  take the food out before the spillage gets worse.

_Activity 4:_ Dad started the microwave but forgot to put in the food. The empty microwave is now operating, which may reduce its service life. If this happens, the internal yellow light will turn brighter, allowing the user to see the inside clearer.

_Activity 5:_ Mom wants to reheat food but the venting is obstructed. It is dangerous having the venting obstructed, so once this happens, a flashing red light will show up as a warning and users won't be able to start microwaving.

_Activity 6:_ Dad is heating up food in the microwave. He forgets that his food is still inside even after the food is done microwaving. Once the microwave is done, it starts flashing a light to signify that the operation is complete. 

_Activity 7:_ Mom wants to reheat the leftover, but the food itself is too dry so it is unable to have enough water to reheat. Once this happens, the internal purple light will turn brighter, allowing the user to see the inside clearer.

_Goal 1:_ To protect people from misapplying the unallowable material of tableware e.g. metal, aluminum foil, and carton.

_Goal 2:_ To allow the user to check if the food has been properly heated without having to take it out, try it, and potentially have to reheat it again.

_Goal 3:_ To prevent spillage from getting worse by displaying a light on the outside of the microwave if food spills.

_Goal 4:_ To avoid the microwave operating empty and prolong the life of the microwave.

_Goal 5:_ To ensure the microwave does not operate while having the venting obstructed.

_Goal 6:_ To indicate that food is ready.

_Goal 7:_ To ensure the food has enough moisture to be reheated.

Storyboards are a tool for visually exploring a users interaction with a device. They are a fast and cheap method to understand user flow, and iterate on a design before attempting to build on it. Take some time to read through this explanation of [storyboarding in UX design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/storyboarding-ux-design/). Sketch seven storyboards of the interactions you are planning. **It does not need to be perfect**, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 

\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*
![27C08270-CC7E-4475-A327-EDD17568E3C1](https://github.com/cctsao2000/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/60999245/7684de36-a861-4527-90cd-43a42dca6726)

Present your ideas to the other people in your breakout room (or in small groups). You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

- Activity 2 has rather low feasibility due to the technical barrier of measuring the food's inner temperature via infrared
- It may be better if the microwave stops operating automatically after detecting a spillage (Activity 3)

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

- For the first activity, the internal light of the microwave will flash red light if there is unallowable material inside but people will still ignore it if they are not paying attention to the microwave
  
\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

- Besides lighting, all activities could be combined with certain sound effects to ensure users receive the information the machine is trying to convey.

## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

- When using public wifi, the IPv4 addresses of the server and the mobile devices may be different, thus leading to a failed connection.
- The audio has a latency especially when connected with multiple devices

## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

https://github.com/cctsao2000/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/60999245/30881fd2-d0f4-4cb5-b4ca-615a47831155


Now, change the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype.   
(Note: View the interaction with the paper prototype in [Part E.](#part-e-costume-the-device))

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

Upon deeper investigation of this application, we have discovered that there is an evident delay in synchronizing actions across all devices. The delay in altering the displayed color is insignificant, whereas the delay in producing a sound exceeds one second.

https://github.com/cctsao2000/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/60999245/196eee7b-f6a2-4c52-8ad3-10eb78d2c758



## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*
![Device Sketch](https://github.com/cctsao2000/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/60999245/e75239e2-e389-4562-9e1a-e86c91b78baa)

![Device Photo](https://github.com/cctsao2000/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/60999245/13f3b5df-326b-4cf7-928a-c58fd1abfe34)

\*\***What concerns or opportunities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

Concerns: 
- Some of the sensors may not function well in high-temperature environments. These sensors should be placed outside of the microwave.
- The internal and external light of the microwave should present a greater visual difference to prevent confusion

Opportunities: The light of the device could integrate with the original light of the microwave. 

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

We received a total of 7 comments from students in different groups. There is a shared appreciation for the creativity and effort put into the microwave cardboard prototype. Some suggested adding sound functions and continuous color changing for improved user engagement and control. Most of the partners are also interested in how we might integrate the device with technology to benefit potential microwave users. Overall, our 7 partners are impressed with the practical details of our design process.

---

Feedback from our 7 partners

John Li: Wow! I never thought of this idea. I do hope to see more interaction between your device and the user though, maybe try to add a sound function to engage the user. Or add a bad food detect function.

Crystal: Amazing! Love the prototypes, my concern would be creating the actual device and detecting the scenarios, since the interactions are between the food and the colors.

Yunfei Jiao: I like the wide range of functions that you have come up with to improve microwave usage. The cardboard prototype is creative and straightforward for demonstrating. It would be nice if the color changing is continuous rather than binary, so that the users could have better visualization and control.

Neel: It was really cool. Favorite two functions were detecting food spillage and if the material is microwavable. One thing we could add could be to have text instead of just light.

Kazim: It was a very interesting device. The prototypes looked amazing, I didn’t expect you to make your own microwave, that was pretty impressive getting it all to work. The details seemed pretty thought out and all of the interactions seemed pretty useful and throroughly thought out. Great job.

Yiming: The design of your device is very interesting. I am also amazed by how you carry the idea out to the real-word setting. Great job! I am also excited to see how this device can be integrated with technology to benefit people’s lives.

Tahmid: The microwave prototype was outstandingly creative! The fact that you guys had multiple storyboards for each scenario is very well detailed having multiple videos explaining each of the step by step process was very helpful in helping us follow your design process.

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
