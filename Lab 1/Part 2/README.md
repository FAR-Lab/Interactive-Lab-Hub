## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

Feedback:
1. Lots of effort, it's pretty clear and that's good but it didn't have to be. Liked editing of the video, it's one video instead of several, could explain the activity and role more in the storyboards, but is a pretty strong lab overall.
2. The first two interactions are interesting and novel, and can dig deeper into what kind of treasure it is and explain more of it. For the trash sorter, I think it’s a useful idea I would like to have in real life. In the video, it is easier for people to identify which type of the items are. Awesome idea!
3. 

## Make it your own

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*

## Part A. Plan 

Storyboard 1: Maze
* Setting: Treasure Island (Mysterious Maze Treasure Hunt)
* Players: Guy1 (unfamiliar with the map), Guy2 (familiar with the map)
* Activity: They are trying to figure out how to use the map. The map lights up the closer you get to the treasure. 
* Goals: To find the treasure using the map (our devices), which gradually illuminates the area ahead to help the user find the correct path.

*Quick Description:* A user with a map (dude 1) is exploring unknown terrain. His map changes colors, but as he approaches the treasure he so dearly desires, the map becomes brighter and brighter until it is almost blinding. He is close to the treasure he is looking for.

Storyboard 2: Treasure hunt again, no maze
* Setting: Treasure Island (Mysterious Treasure Hunt)
* Players: explorer with lighting-up map 
* Activity: They are exploring the island. The map lights up corresponding to the colors of the natural environment. However, when close to treasure, the map will light up yellow 
* Goals: To find the treasure using the map (our devices), which gradually illuminates the area ahead to help the user find the correct path.

Storyboard 3: Pet feeding reminder
* Setting: The homes of pet owners.
* Players: The owner of a pet (e.g. a dog or cat), pet.
* Activity: The device can be placed at a place where the user will often be around, for example beside their bed. When there is not enough food or water in the pet’s bowl, the device will light up according to what is about to run out (e.g. yellow for food and blue for water). This way, the user will remember to add more food/water for the pet even if they do not walk to the pet’s bowls.
* Goals: To help remind pet owners to add food/water for their pets.

Storyboard 4: Trash Sorter
* Setting: The refuse room in buildings in Shanghai. (Shanghai has a mandatory sorting scheme, requiring residents to separate trash into four categories: recyclable, hazardous, wet (perishable) and dry (other) waste, and many people are confused by these categories)
* Players: A person who is wanting to throw away trash according to categories.
* Activity: When the user shows the trash to the trash sorter, the trash sorter will respond to which kind of trash it is by chasing color. For example blue for recyclable trash, green for wet trash, etc.
* Goals: To help the user categorize the kinds of trash, so they can throw trash into the correct bins.

Storyboard 5: Magical Reminder Clock
* Setting: Bedroom of any person with a magical clock
* Players: A person and his magical reminder clock
* Activity: The magical reminder flashes colors to remind the user to do several actions. It changes colors and makes noise to tell the user what to do. Eg. 
* Goals: Get the user to do the action that the reminder is trying to remind the user to do.

Storyboard 6: Smartplant Reader
* Setting: Just any room with a plant and a person
* Players: A person who owns a plant
* Activity: The person is figuring out what a plant likes by attempting several actions towards the plant (watering it or feeding it)
* Goals: Get the plant happy and growing

*Quick Description:* So we have a dude who is surprised to see a plant in his room. He sees it is sad so he tries to offer it food. The plant is angry at the offering. The man then offers the plant some water in a bottle and the plant looks neutral. The man finally sprinkles water on the plant and the plant becomes happy. The plant also likes music :D. It gets sad around arguing.

Storyboard 7: Plants again but tinkerbell is the pot itself rather than an attachment
* Setting: Just any room with a plant and a person
* Players: A person who owns a plant
* Activity: The person is figuring out what a is good for the plant by attempting several actions towards the plant (watering it, feeding it, providing sunlight) and responding to pot’s assessments
* Goals: Get the plant happy and growing

*Quick Description:* So we have a person who is surprised to see a plant in his room. In this scenario, the pot monitors the well-being and emotional state of the plant, and communicates to the person that it is thirsty. Offering food at first makes the pot angry. The man then offers the plant some water in a bottle and the plant looks neutral. The man finally sprinkles water on the plant and the plant becomes happy. The plant also likes music :D. It gets sad around arguing.

**Summarize feedback you got here.**

Based on asking around, we were able to get limited feedback around our ideas, particularly around the first idea we were told it seemed interesting and asking the TA were told it covered all of our basic requirements. From that idea we created the rest of the six and we found out that they were kind of interesting and fun ideas. We learned that we could definitely be a bit more creative since some of the ideas are rather similar. We will take it into consideration (next week!).

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**

We chose storyboard 4 (Garbage sorter) to act out. One challenge was finding the right trash can setup on campus that would be the best to communicate the interaction to users. The first garbage we found only had two bins to place items into and limited signage describing what was meant to go in each bin. Thus, we’ve found a garbage bin in Bloomberg that has three receptacles (paper recycle, plastic recycle, and landfill) plus an extra bin we use to represent compost. Another thing that will be important to do right is the blocking, specifically making sure that the interactions (scanning the food, placing the food into the trash, etc.) don’t block the view of the bin signs and our screen/device when recording.

When we act out the interaction, we have to think more about the position of the device, where it is placed so the user can see it better. We originally thought we might place the screen/scanner on the trash bin (and thus below the opening), but it turned out to be very awkward to bend down and wave garbage below the bin. It will make more sense to position the screen/scanner higher so that you wave your garbage above the bins, near where you’ll end up tossing the garbage.

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**

We can add more trash types. Particularly compost. 

## Part C. Prototype the device

**Give us feedback on [Tinkerbelle](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).**

Tinkerbelle works well but has a small problem. We can't save the colors we choose. So, every time we use it, we have to pick the colors again if we don't want to use the default ones. It would be better if we could save our favorite colors.

## Part D. Wizard the device

**Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**
**Show the follow-up work here.**

Our first attempt at setting it up was a successful attempt so it will be included in the final video.

## Part E. Costume the device

**Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**

Embedded screen 2

**What concerns or opportunities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**

The main concern was not being able to confuse the device as trash itself. Another concern would be potential contamination from trash being moved over the device. There is potential for water from a water bottle to drip onto the device causing potential water damage. It needs to be dressed to not look like something to throw away as well as be protected from potential garbage, but the latter may be solved with better placement.

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.

## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
