# You're a wizard, Rui!! üò±üßô

In this lab, we want you to practice wizarding an interactive device as discussed in class. We will focus on audio as the main modality for interaction but there is no reason these general techniques can't extend to video, haptics or other interactive mechanisms. In fact, you are welcome to add those to your project if they enhance your design.


## Text to Speech and Speech to Text

In the home directory of your Pi there is a folder called `text2speech` containing some shell scripts.

```
pi@ixe00:~/text2speech $ ls
Download        festival_demo.sh  GoogleTTS_demo.sh  pico2text_demo.sh
espeak_demo.sh  flite_demo.sh     lookdave.wav

```

you can run these examples by typing 
`./espeakdeom.sh`. Take some time to look at each script and see how it works. You can see a script by typing `cat filename`

```
pi@ixe00:~/text2speech $ cat festival_demo.sh 
#from: https://elinux.org/RPi_Text_to_Speech_(Speech_Synthesis)#Festival_Text_to_Speech

echo "Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?" | festival --tts

```

You can also play audio files directly with `aplay filename`.

After looking through this folder do the same for the `speech2text` folder. In particular, look at `test_words.py` and make sure you understand how the vocab is defined. Then try `./vosk_demo_mic.sh`

## Serving Pages

In Lab 1 we served a webpage with flask. In this lab you may find it useful to serve a webpage for the controller on a remote device. Here is a simple example of a webserver.

```
pi@ixe00:~/$ python server.py
 * Serving Flask app "server" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 162-573-883
```
From a remote browser on the same network, check to make sure your webserver is working by going to [http://ixe00.local:5000]()


## Demo

In the [demo directory](./demo), you will find an example wizard of oz project you may use as a template. **You do not have to** feel free to get creative. In that project, you can see how audio and sensor data is streamed from the Pi to a wizard controller that runs in the browser. You can control what system says from the controller as well.

## Optional

There is an included [dspeech](.dspeech) demo that uses [Mozilla DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) for speech to text. If you're interested in trying it out we suggest you create a seperarate virutalenv. 



# Lab 3 Part 2

Create a system that runs on the Raspberry Pi that takes in one or more sensors and requires participants to speak to it. Document how the system works and include videos of both the system and the controller.

## Prep for Part 2

1. Sketch ideas for what you'll work on in lab on Wednesday.

The wizarding device is called the SimonCowell because it will judge a contestant's singing or dancing performance and provide feedback. If the performer gives a good performance, the SimonCowell will provide them with positive feedback and advance the contestant to the next round. If the performer gives a bad performance, the SimonCowell will provide them with negative feedback and tell them to leave. 

As a default, if the user does not press the button, the motion sensor will detect a dancing performance and the SimonCowell will watch the performance and provide them with feedback depending on whether the performance was good or not. If the user presses the red button, it will signal to the device that they are about to sing. The SimonCowell will then listen to the user sing and judge whether or not it is a good performance by providing feedback. 

In this lab, the accelerometer was used to detect the participant's motion/dancing and the Qwiic button was pressed to detect the participant's singing. 

## Share your idea sketches with Zoom Room mates and get feedback

*what was the feedback? Who did it come from?*

Brandt Beckerman: "Good idea! I like how it takes in movement and audio and the device will give a verbal response back." 

Antonio Mojena: "It's sort of like an 8 ball where you just shake it and you get a response. I wonder if you could make the device like a mic so that it senses how much you move while you sing and maybe base a response off of the movement as well."

## Prototype your system

The system should:
* use the Raspberry Pi üëç
* use one or more sensors üëç (Qwiic Red Button and Accelerometer)
* require participants to speak to it. üëç (Takes in contestant's singing!)

*Document how the system works*

*Include videos or screencaptures of both the system and the controller.*

## Test the system
Try to get at least two people to interact with your system. (Ideally, you would inform them that there is a wizard _after_ the interaction, but we recognize that can be hard.)
