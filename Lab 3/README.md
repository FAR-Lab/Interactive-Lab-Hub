# You're a wizard, [Student Name Here]

In this lab we want you to practice wizarding an interactive device as discussed in class. We will focus on audio as the main modality for interaction but there is no reason these general techniques can't extend to video, haptics or other interactive mechanisms. In fact you are welcome to add those to your project if they enhance your design.

## Demo

In the [demo directory](./demo) you will find an example wizard of oz project you may use as a template. **You do not have to** feel free to get creative. In that project you can see how audio and sensor data is streamed from the Pi to a wizard controller that runs in the browser. You can control what system says from the controller as well. On your pi already are examples of text to speech and speech to text in the `text2speech` and `speech2text` folders respectively.

## Deliverables

Create a system that runs on the Raspberry Pi that takes in one or more sensors and requires participants to speak to it. Document how the system works and include videos of both the system and the controller

Try to get at least two people to interact with your system. Ideally without them knowing there is a wizard but we recognize that can be hard.
