#
# Base class used to define the interface for the platform classes. 
#
# A platform class performs the following:
#
#   - Determines if the object is executing on it's desired platform
#		- Platforms are strucutre into broad classifications. For example
#			- Linux systems
#			- CircuitPython 
#
#	- Implements platform specific logic to support a given operation (I2C for now)
#
# This specific class does very little besides define the base interface

i2c_driver
============
This is an abstract class used to define the common I2C interface for the qwiic I2C 
implementation. Platform specific drivers sub-class this object and implement the 
neccessary methods.

This package can be used in conjunction with the overall [SparkFun qwiic Python Package](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Py)
