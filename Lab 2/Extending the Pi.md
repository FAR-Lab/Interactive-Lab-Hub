# Extending the Pi

To extend the Pi, we are using breakout boards that connect to the PI using a standard communication bus (I2C)(https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/i2c/all). [StemmaQT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma) and [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic#overview) use a standardized 4-pin connector to connect devices using the I2C protocol. 

The StemmaQT and I2C parts often have a fixed I2C address; to differentiate between similar parts, the devices often have pads that allow additional bits to be pulled high or low. The addresses are in [hexidecimal](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/hexadecimal/introduction) format, things like `0x6f`. This is the hexadecimal (or hex) representation for the decimal number `111` which is represented as `1101111` in binary. You are not expected to make any kinds of conversions but should have some conceptual grasp that a hex value is just a number shown another way. [This Python library](https://towardsdatascience.com/binary-hex-and-octal-in-python-20222488cee1) will assist you if you need help manipulating hexidecimal numbers.

## Connecting a Button

The buttons you've used on the screen are quite simple. Aside from [debouncing](https://learn.adafruit.com/make-it-switch/debouncing), when you press down you are closing a circuit, allowing electricity flow to the pins wired to the two buttons, in this case [GPIO 23](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/pin16_gpio23) and [24](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/pin18_gpio24). That's a perfectly reasonable way to connect a button. I2C is not typically used for buttons but here, we demonstrate one way you might see it. This also allows additional functionality to be built right into the button, such as the ability to remember the last time it was pressed. 

### Hardware

From your kit, take out the [mini-PiTFT](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mini-pitft-135x240-color-tft-add-on-for-raspberry-pi), a [stemmaQT cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4210) and the [Qwiic Button](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16842). <p float="left">

</p>

Connect the one side of cable to the StemmaQT port on the underside of the PiTFT screen. It will only fit in one way, it should not require much force.

#### Setup
As before, connect to your Pi and activate your virtual environment.

```
ssh pi@ixe00
pi@ixe00:~ $ source circuitpython/bin/activate
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~ $ 

```

Navigate to your interactive lab hub, pull changes from upstream, and install new packages. If you have [merge conflicts](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts), you need to resolve them. If you've never done this before ask people in your group for help. Otherwise ask yout TA!

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~$ cd Interactive-Lab-Hub
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git pull upstream Spring2021
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git add .
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git commit -m'merge'
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ cd Lab\ 2/
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 2 $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Open source hardware and software

This class uses a lot of material that is developed with the intention of being free, open and accessible. All of the parts you used for this lab openly post their code and schematics should others want to riff on these designs or learn how they work. You are encouraged to [take](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mini-pitft-135x240-color-tft-add-on-for-raspberry-pi/downloads) [a](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/schematics/rpi_SCH_4b_4p0_reduced.pdf) [look](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Button). You may find that someone has solved your problems for you and neatly packed them in a [library](https://github.com/gmparis/CircuitPython_I2C_Button). Feel free to look at and use solutions that others have posted so long as you **always cite their contributions**. 

To demonstrate the button we are using this [CircuitPython library](https://github.com/gmparis/CircuitPython_I2C_Button). You can also try this [Sparkfun Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Button_Py) which has slightly simpler syntax. The devices and sensors in your kit have libraries that will allow you to integrate them with your Pi using python. They also provide examples of usage. If you are unsure about how to use something, look at its documentation then ask your TAs.

Try running `python library_example.py`. 

Some important things to note from the code:

 * We create an I2C device to handle communication with the pi.
 * We then scan for devices on the bus
 * We check if `default_addr = 0x6f` is listed in the found devices. This is the address your button comes programmed with, you can also change this and have it store the update on the button.
 * Once we initialize the I2C_Button object the rest of the code shows us some of the builtin capabilities.

## Connecting a Sensor

Your kit is full of sensors! Look up what they can do and feel free to ask your TAs, We love to talk sensors. We will go further in depth into sensors in the coming weeks, but we put this small sample here to demonstrate how you can get sensor data if you want to use it for your project this week.

We are going to connect the [Adafruit APDS9960 Proximity, Light, RGB, and Gesture Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3595). You can leave the button plugged in and daisy-chain the sensor, this is part of the magic of I2C.

<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/1200x900/3595-03.jpg" height="200" />


Now run `python proximity.py`.

 
## Under the I2C curtain (optional: complete only after working on your projects in groups)

Run the file `I2C_scan.py` and the output should look like:

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 2 $ python I2C_scan.py 
I2C ok!
I2C addresses found: []

```

Now plug the other end of the cable into the ports on the right of the button board. The pwr LED should turn on. Run the file again and you should see the device ID. You can also try daisy chaining multiple devices and sensors and running again.

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 2 $ python I2CTest.py 
I2C ok!
I2C addresses found: ['0x6f']
```
#### Read device registers

With I2C devices we can read the registers directly with `button_registers.py`. Run the command to see what the current registers for the button are. You can look [here](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/8/Qwiic_Button_I2C_Register_Map.pdf) to try and figure out what the output means.

#### Leverage abstraction

Use a higher level device interface can make reading and writing registers for I2C devices easier. Try running `button_device.py` and pressing the button. Look at the code and the [list of registers](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/8/Qwiic_Button_I2C_Register_Map.pdf) and see if you can figure out what line 56 is for.

```
56               write_register(device, STATUS, 0)
```
