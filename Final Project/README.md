# Tangible Cryptocurrency Safe

Wenqing Tang and Heidi He

Our project will design a tangible safe that stores the user's cryptocurrency token in Raspberry Pi.

Users can secure their tokens with password that will be a combination of keypad input and qwiic twist input. The safe will have also a small screen to display text, a microphone to collect audio input and a speaker to output sounds.

If the user is forced to open the safe under some threats, he can use an emergency password so the device will only show tokens with less values. The camera will also be secretly activated to capture what's happening and the device will send a message to call the police.
