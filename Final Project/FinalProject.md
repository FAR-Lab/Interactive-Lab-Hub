# Final Project

Using the tools and techniques you learned in this class, design, prototype and test an interactive device.

Project plan - November 22

Peer feedback on Project plans: November 24

Functional check-off - November 30 & December 2

Final Project Presentations - December 7

Write-up and documentation due - December 13

## Objective

The goal of this final project is for you to have a fully functioning and well-designed interactive device of your own design.
 
## Description

The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated the concerns around elderly homecare. As older adults are confined to home alone, they are more vulnerable to falling. According to CDC, there are about 36 million older adults fall each year, which results in more than 32,000 deaths. Inspired by this shocking fact, we decide to build a device to potentially address this issue.

Introducing FallSafe, a wearable device to detect falls and share the information with emergency contact. Using accelerometer, the device would be able to determine whether a person is falling by sensing motion and measuring the rate of change of the velocity. The device is also integrated with a communication system via MQTT which we explored in Lab 6. Transmitting the information immediately with emergency contact would allow people to respond promptly to prevent severe consequences.

## Deliverables

1. Project plan: Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan. <br />

Feedback on the project plan -
```
Really useful idea that could really help people. How would the device be worn? 
Consider working this out as well: is it watertight to also be used in the shower? 
Does it need charging? Does it show what its state is? Seems like a good amount of work for two people.
```
```
From a feasibility perspective, it may be hard to differentiate a fall 
from a fast movement using just the accelerator, unless there is a clear pattern present. 
Your backup plan seems very doable with CV though, and interesting.
```

2. Functioning project: The finished project should be a device, system, interface, etc. that people can interact with.

3. Documentation of design process
The idea and interaction is illustrated in the storyboard below.

4. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
5. Video of someone using your project
6. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)

7. Group work distribution questionnaire

## Change of Design

It is fine to change your project goals, but please resubmit the project plan for the new design when you do that.


## Teams

You can and are not required to work in teams. Be clear in documentation who contributed what. The total project contributions should reflect the number of people on the project.

## Examples

[Here is a list of good final projects from previous classes.](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/Previous-Final-Projects)
This version of the class is very different, but it may be useful to see these.
