#### Filtering, FFTs, and Time Series data. 
> **_NOTE:_**  This section is from an earlier version of the class.

Additional filtering and analysis can be done on the sensors that were provided in the kit. For example, running a Fast Fourier Transform over the IMU or Microphone data stream could create a simple activity classifier between walking, running, and standing.

To get the microphone working we need to install two libraries. `PyAudio` to get the data from the microphone, `sciPy` to make data analysis easy, and the `numpy-ringbuffer` to keep track of the last ~1 second of audio. 
Pyaudio needs to be installed with the following comand:
``sudo apt install python3-pyaudio``
SciPy is installed with 
``sudo apt install python3-scipy`` 

Lastly we need numpy-ringbuffer, to make continues data anlysis easier.
``pip install numpy-ringbuffer``

Now try the audio processing example:
* Find what ID the micrpohone has with `python ListAvalibleAudioDevices.py`
    Look for a device name that includes `USB` in the name.
* Adjust the variable `DEVICE_INDEX` in the `ExampleAudioFFT.py` file.
    See if you are getting results printed out from the microphone. Try to understand how the code works.
    Then run the file by typing `python ExampleAudioFFT.py`



Using the microphone, try one of the following:

**1. Set up threshold detection** Can you identify when a signal goes above certain fixed values?

**2. Set up a running averaging** Can you set up a running average over one of the variables that are being calculated.[moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average)

**3. Set up peak detection** Can you identify when your signal reaches a peak and then goes down?
