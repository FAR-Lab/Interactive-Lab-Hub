## Listening Exercise
Go through some of the videos below, listen to the sound, and write down the different sounds that belong to a certain context. Think about the impact a given sound has on how we construct our own contextual understanding. *Please try to not watch the video as you listen to the sound.*


Ideally, write down the ideas in a table like this

| Sound | Influence on the context | Implications for your behavior |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| car horn | creates a sense of urgency | look arround | 
| foot steps | ... | ... |
| ... | ... |... |
|  ... |  ... |... |
