                Combining  the `amplitudes` and `frequencies` varialbes allows you to understand how loud a certain frequency is.
                e.g. If you'd like to know the volume for 500Hz you could do the following. 
                1. Find the frequency bin in which 500Hz belis closest to with:
                FrequencyBin = np.abs(frequencies - 500).argmin()
                
                2. Look up the volume in that bin:
                amplitudes[FrequencyBin]
                The example below does something similar, just in revers.
                It finds the loudest amplitued and its coresponding bin  with `argmax()`. 
                The uses the index to look up the Freqeucny value.
