    **Quickstart: Importing and using the APDS9960**

        Here is an example of using the :class:`APDS9960` class.
        First you will need to import the libraries to use the sensor

        .. code-block:: python

            import board
            from adafruit_apds9960.apds9960 import APDS9960

        Once this is done you can define your `board.I2C` object and define your sensor object

        .. code-block:: python

            i2c = board.I2C()   # uses board.SCL and board.SDA
            apds = APDS9960(i2c)

        Now you have access to the :attr:`apds.proximity_enable` and :attr:`apds.proximity`
        attributes

        .. code-block:: python

            apds.proximity_enable = True
            proximity = apds.proximity

        .. note:: There is no ``address`` argument because the APDS-9960 only has one address and
           doesn't offer any option to configure alternative addresses.

    def enable(self) -> bool:
        """If ``True``, the sensor is enabled.

        If set to ``False``, the sensor will enter a low-power sleep state

        When enabled, the sensor's state machine will run through the following steps in sequence,
        repeating from the top after all states are run through.

        #. **Idle State**

            - Will only remain in this state if all three sense engines are disabled.

        #. **Proximity Engine** *(if enabled)*

            - Will only run if `enable_proximity` is ``True``.
            - Will run once, storing fresh data in the sensor's proximity data registers. If
              proximity data is is lower than or exceeds the configured proximity thresholds an
              internal persistence is incremented on each run as well.

        #. **Gesture Engine** *(if enabled)*

            - Will only run if `enable_gesture` is ``True`` and if entry threshold of `proximity`
              is greater or equal to the gesture proximity entry threshold of 5 counts.
            - Will continuously loop, storing new results in the sensor's gesture FIFO buffers,
              until one of four conditions occur.

                - Exit threshold is met. *(all gesture measurements <= 30 counts)*
                - The gesture engine or sensor are disabled. *(`enable_gesture` or `enable`
                  properties are set to ``False``)*
                - The sensor is re-initalized by the driver
                - The sensor is power cycled

        #. **Wait Timer** *(set to 0 by default)*

            - This driver does not set or make available the ``WAIT`` or ``WLONG`` registers that
              control this function and, on intialization, leaves the timer at its power-on default
              state of ``0``, effectively disabling this timer.

        #. **Color/Light Engine** *(if enabled)*

            - Will run start if `enable_color` is ``True``.
            - Will run once, storing fresh data in the sensor's color data registers on each run.

        .. note:: Waking the sensor from its sleep state takes at least 7 ms. Disabling the sensor
           and entering a sleep state can take as little as 2.78 ms, more typically about 25 ms, or
           potentially quite a bit longer depending on what engines were enabled and what state was
           active at the time the disable command was received.

        .. hint:: When in a sleep state the sensor's power usage drops to as little as 1-10 uA,
           compared as much as 790 uA of power usage when enabled with proximity and/or gesture
           engines running. While in a sleep state, the sensor will still listen for and respond
           to I2C communication which can lead to minor increases in power usage.

        2. High Threshold (``PIHT``) *(optional)*
        3. Proximity Persistence (``PERS<PPERS>``) *(optional)*

        The first two items are the "low threshold" and "high threshold" values. These can be set
        to any number between ``0`` and ``255``. If the proximity value is lower than the low
        threshold or higher than the high threshold for enough cycles, an interrupt will be
        asserted.

        The third item is the "persistence" value. This can be set to any value between ``0`` to
        ``15``. This represents the number of 2.78 ms out-of-threshold cycles to wait for before
        asserting the interrupt. This is basically a filter to prevent premature/false interrupts.

        .. hint:: For example, setting a low threshold of ``0`` and a high threshold of ``5`` will
           cause the interrupt to be asserted very early when an object **enters the sensor's line
           of sight**. Coversely, a low threshold of ``5`` and a high threshold of ``255`` will
           trigger an interrupt only if an object **is removed from the sensor's line of sight**.

        .. hint:: Tuning the persistence value can be useful in some use cases but for most
           situations the driver's default value of 4 should provide for stable results without
           much delay in interrupt triggering.

    ## GESTURE DETECTION

    def gesture(self) -> int:
        """Gesture sensor data.

        This checks the sensor for new gesture engine results and, if they are present, retrieves
        and processes the results to determine what, if any, gesture can be deduced from the sensor
        data.

        Returns a gesture code indicating the direction of the gesture. Before returning the code,
        the `rotation` value is used to "rotate" the result as intended.

        .. csv-table::
           :header: "Code", "Direction"

            2, "Down"
            3, "Left"

        .. caution:: Will always return ``0`` if `enable_proximity` and `enable_gesture` are not set
           to ``True``.

        The data returned by the sensor is a continuous stream of four proximtiy measurements
        constrained to up/down/left/right dimensions by using four directionally-aligned sensors.
        The sensor itself doesn't include any logic to determine the gesture, leaving that work to
        the implementer.

        This driver implements an algorithm that reliably detects simple gestures in most scenarios
        while remaining small and efficient enough to work within the resource constraints of as
        many CircuitPython boards/platforms as possible.

        .. tip:: Detecting gestures with this driver's algorithm requires actively, continously
           polling for a gesture, with as little time as possible between `gesture()` calls. Even
           with continous polling, however, its possible that gestures may go undetected by
           `gesture()` calls if they occurred between or on the edges of `gesture()` method
           execution.

        .. warning:: If gesture data becomes available from the sensor, this driver will
           continuously pull in that new data and analyze it until the sensor's gesture engine
           exits and the sensor's FIFO buffers are clear. This allows for much more reliable
           gesture detection by comparing the "first" to the "last" detected state at the cost of
           blocking until the FIFOs are all clear. This will only happen if all four gesture values
           drop below ``30``.

           As a result, if an object is close to the sensor when `gesture()` is called, the method
           will not return until it moves away.

        .. note:: The sensor itself offers a very wide variety of configuration options for tuning
           the gesture engine, such as the LEDs (pulse count/length, drive power), the photosensors
           (gain, offsets, masking), the gesture engine's entry/exit thresholds, wait time, and
           more. However, this driver does not make those readily available in order to keep file
           size and memory footprint to a minimum, which is critical for its use on more
