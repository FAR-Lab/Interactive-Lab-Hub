## Introduction

The point of this lab is to introduce you to distributed interaction. We've included a some Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generation (NLG) but those are not really the emphasis. Feel free to dig into the examples and play around the code which you can integrate into your projects. However we want to emphasize the grading will focus on your ability to develop interesting uses for messaging across distributed devices. 



## MQTT

MQTT is a lightweight messaging portal invented in 1999 for low bandwidth networks. It was later adopted as a defacto standard for a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. 

#### The Bits

* **Broker** - The central server node that receives all messages and sends them out to the interested clients. Our broker is hosted on the far lab server (Thanks David!) at `farlab.infosci.cornell.edu/8883`
* **Client** - A device that subscribes or publishes information on the network
* **Topic** - The location data gets published to. These are hierarchical with subtopics. If you were making a network of IoT smart bulbs this might look like `home/livingroom/sidelamp/light_status` and `home/livingroom/sidelamp/voltage`. Subscribing to `home/livingroom/sidelamp/#` would give you message updates to both the light_status and the voltage. Because we use this broker for a variety of projects you have access to read, write and create subtopics of `IDD`. This means `IDD/ilan/is/a/goof` is a valid topic you can send data messages to.
*  **Subscribe** - This is a way of telling the client to pay attention to messages the broker sends out on that topic. You can subscribe to a specific topic or subtopics. You can also unsubscribe
* **Publish** - This is a way of sending messages to a topic. You can publish to topics you don't subscribe to. Just remember on our broker you are limited to subtopics of `IDD`

Setting up a broker isn't much work but for the purposes of this class you should all use the broker we've set up for you. 

#### Useful Tooling

Debugging and visualizing what's happening on your MQTT broker can be helpful. We like [MQTT Explorer](http://mqtt-explorer.com/).You can connect by putting in the settings from the image below.

Once connected you should be able to see all the messaged on the IDD topic. From the interface you can send and plot messages as well.
