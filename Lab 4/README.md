# Ph-UI!!!

For lab this week, we focus on the prototyping the physical look and feel of the device. _Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

1. Pull the new Github Repo.
2. Readings: 

* [What do prototypes prototype?](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/What-do-Prototypes-Prototype-Houde-Hill/30bc6125fab9d9b2d5854223aeea7900a218f149)

* [Paper prototyping](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/paper-prototyping-the-practical-beginners-guide/) is used by UX designers to quickly develop interface ideas and run them by people before any programming occurs. 

* [Cardboard prototypes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_9Q-KDSb9o) help interactive product designers to work through additional issues, like how big something should be, how it could be carried, where it would sit. 

* [Tips to Cut, Fold, Mold and Papier-Mache Cardboard](https://makezine.com/2016/04/21/working-with-cardboard-tips-cut-fold-mold-papier-mache/) from Make Magazine.

* [Surprisingly complicated forms](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/50032245843343100/) can be built with paper, cardstock or cardboard.  The most advanced and challenging prototypes to prototype with paper are [cardboard mechanisms](https://www.pinterest.com/helgangchin/paper-mechanisms/) which move and change.

### For lab, you will need:

1. Cardboard (start collecting those shipping boxes!)
1. Cutting board
1. Cutting tools
1. Markers
1. Found objects and materials--like bananas--we're not saying that to be funny.


### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Sketches/photos of device designs
1. "Looks like" prototypes: show us what how the device should look, feel, sit, weigh, etc.
3. "Works like" prototypes: show us what the device can do
4. "Acts like" prototypes: videos/storyboards/other means of showing how a person would interact with the device
5. Submit these in the lab 4 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same for each person in the group.

## The Report
This readme.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done. You can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. 

Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in the readme.

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

### Part A
### Capacitive Sensing, a.k.a. Human Banana Interaction

We wanted to introduce you to the [capacitive sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mpr121-gator) in your kit. It's one of the most flexible input devices we were able to provide. At boot it measures the capacitance on each of the 12 contacts. Whenever that capacitance changes it considers it a user touch. You can attach any conductive material. In your kit you have conductive fabric and copper tape that will work well, but don't limit yourself! In this lab we will use (go?) bananas!

</p>

Plug in the capacitive sensor board with the qwiic connector. Connect your banana's with either the copper tape or the alligator clips (the clips work better). make sure to install the requirements from `requirements.txt`

### Following is my Human Tangerine Interaction implementation :tangerine:

### Part B
### OLED screen

We just received some of the small oled screens that we had coped to include in your kit. If you want one feel free to pop into the lab and get one. These don't have colors like the one on the pi but you can move it around on a cable making for more flexible interface design. The way you program this display is almost identical to the pi display. Take a look at `oled_test.py` and some more of the [Adafruit examples](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SSD1306/tree/master/examples).

### Part C
### Paper Display

Here is an Pi with a paper faceplate on it to turn it into a display:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/paper_if.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>


This is fine, but it can be a bit difficult to lay out a great and user friendly display within the constraints of the Pi. Also, it really only works for applications where people can come and stand over the Pi, or where you can mount the Pi to the wall.

Here is another prototype for a paper display:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/b_box.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>

It holds a pi and usb power supply, and provides a front stage on which to put writing, graphics, LEDs, buttons or displays.

This design can be made by scoring a long strip of corrugated cardboard of width X, with the following measurements:

| Y height of box <br> <sub><sup>- thickness of cardboard</sup></sub> | Z  depth of box <br><sub><sup>- thickness of cardboard</sup></sub> | Y height of box  | Z  depth of box | H height of faceplate <br><sub><sup>* * * * * (don't make this too short) * * * * *</sup></sub>|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 

Fold the first flap of the strip so that it sits flush against the back of the face plate, and tape, velcro or hot glue it in place. This will make a H x X interface, with a box of Z x X footprint (which you can adapt to the things you want to put in the box) and a height Y in the back. 

Here is an example:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/horoscope.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>


Make a paper display for your project that communicates the state of the Pi and a sensor. Ideally you should design it so that you can slide the Pi out to work on the circuit or programming, and then slide it back in and reattach a few wires to be back in operation.
 
**a. Document the design for your paper display.** (e.g. if you had to make it again from scratch, what information would you need?). Include interim iterations (or at least tell us about them).

![alt text](https://github.com/iamyuchy/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%204/paper_design.png)

The paper display I have made is in a layered bento box style. The bottom layer holds the respberry pi and the top layer contains the input & output devices with the display. At the back of the bottom layer, there is also a window for the power cord. Each layer can be removed and stacked separately, so it allows me to pull the raspberry pi out for debug. The demension of the 2-layer box is about 15cm * 15cm * 7cm.

**b. Make a video of your paper display in action.**

Link for the video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SET2QU-ZippKPggumsWwCOc9RRnFyEZ1/view?usp=sharing

**c. Explain the rationale for the design.** (e.g. Does it need to be a certain size or form or need to be able to be seen from a certain distance?)

My device is a PiTest Bot, so I want it to be small and cute. That's way I have created a box that can be hold in one hand, also won't take too much space if put it on the table.


### Part D
### Materiality

**Open Ended**: We are putting very few constraints on this part but we want you to get creative.

Design a system with the Pi and anything from your kit with a focus on form, and materiality. The "stuff" that enclose the system should be informed by the desired interaction. What would a computer made of rocks be like? How would an ipod made of grass behave? Would a roomba made of gold clean your floor any differently?

**a. document the material prototype.** Include candidates that were considered even if they were set aside later.

**b. explain the selection.**

### Part 2.

Following exploration and reflection from Part 1, complete the "looks like," "works like" and "acts like" prototypes for your design.

Reiterating:
### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Sketches/photos of device designs
1. "Looks like" prototypes: show us what how the device should look, feel, sit, weigh, etc.
3. "Works like" prototypes: show us what the device can do
4. "Acts like" prototypes: videos/storyboards/other means of showing how a person would interact with the device
5. Submit these in the lab 4 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same for each person in the group.
