# Ph-UI!!!

## Prep

### For lab, you will need:

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Sketches/photos of device designs
1. "Looks like" prototypes: show us what how the device should look, feel, sit, weigh, etc.
3. "Works like" prototypes: show us what the device can do
4. "Acts like" prototypes: videos/storyboards/other means of showing how a person would interact with the device
5. Submit these in the lab 4 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same for each person in the group.

## Overview


## The Report


### Part A
### Capacitive Sensing, a.k.a. Human Banana Interaction

### Part B
### OLED screen


### Part C
### Paper Display

 
**a. Document the design for your paper display.** (e.g. if you had to make it again from scratch, what information would you need?). Include interim iterations (or at least tell us about them).

Here are my initial sketches of the device design, mat layout, and final form factor:

Feedback on initial device design sketches:

Rob: Liked the first and last designs (of the top 4) because he thought the jukebox is nostalgic but works for a smarthome
Irene: maybe you can do it so that the person holding the "ball" gets to play a song. It could even tell you how long they have had it (been the DJ)
Anu: she liked the 2nd of the top 4 designs, thought maybe you could stick it to the wall
Someone said it would be cool if it accepted money and allowed you to control the songs if you put money in
Ilan: could be cool if it was randomized with something like playing cards to decide who picks the next song

From the feedback I decided to choose option 1 of the top 4 designs, because I felt it was important other people in the room could see the screen from a distance, but that the mat would be the best way to control it. Additionally, the jukebox look gives it a cool nostalgic feel and enables it to also serve as a decoration piece. I also added different modes of selecting a DJ, including rotating automatically after a certain amount of time, and random selection.

Then I did the sketches of what the screens would actually look like (also pictured above)

Last I did the actual form factor of the jukebox:

I leveraged Google images for ideas on how to make it look like an old fashioned JukeBox

Here is the final paper prototype:

**b. Make a video of your paper display in action.**

**c. Explain the rationale for the design.** (e.g. Does it need to be a certain size or form or need to be able to be seen from a certain distance?)

The device is meant to be both functional and decorative. As a result, I wanted to make it large enough so that the screen would be big enough for people to see if they are sitting across the room, and so that the mat would be easy to control, but not too large that that it couldn't easily fit in many different homes on top of a media stand or a shelf. I wanted it to look cool and be decorative and not take up too much space. Therefore, this size is just about perfect, and it's roughly the same size as various other items you'd have displayed in a living room. It will most likely weigh 5-10 lbs.

### Part D
### Materiality

**Open Ended**: We are putting very few constraints on this part but we want you to get creative.



**a. document the material prototype.** Include candidates that were considered even if they were set aside later.
- Marble
- Plant-based leather
- screens

**b. explain the selection.**

This device is meant to be a decorative work of art that can be passed down from generation to generation. The hardware is separate from the software, so that the software can be constantly updated, and what is shown on the screens will change overtime, but the device itself will remain the same. Right now it is set up to display Spotify, but in the future that may be different.

Therefore I want the device to be made of beautiful and sustainable material. this way it will look great, last over time, and not damage the environment. The top half of the device which is the jukebox will be made out of crafted marble, while the sides of the mat will be made out of a plant-based leather substitute. Each will have a screen inside. Marble can be heavy, but because this device isn't meant to be moved much that will be fine.
Design a system with the Pi and anything from your kit with a focus on form, and materiality. The "stuff" that enclose the system should be informed by the desired interaction. What would a computer made of rocks be like? How would an ipod made of grass behave? Would a roomba made of gold clean your floor any differently?
