# Ph-UI!!!

## Prep

### For lab, you will need:

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Sketches/photos of device designs
1. "Looks like" prototypes: show us what how the device should look, feel, sit, weigh, etc.
3. "Works like" prototypes: show us what the device can do
4. "Acts like" prototypes: videos/storyboards/other means of showing how a person would interact with the device
5. Submit these in the lab 4 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same for each person in the group.

## Overview


## The Report


### Part A
### Capacitive Sensing, a.k.a. Human Banana Interaction

### Part B
### OLED screen


### Part C
### Paper Display

 
**a. Document the design for your paper display.** (e.g. if you had to make it again from scratch, what information would you need?). Include interim iterations (or at least tell us about them).

**b. Make a video of your paper display in action.**

**c. Explain the rationale for the design.** (e.g. Does it need to be a certain size or form or need to be able to be seen from a certain distance?)

### Part D
### Materiality

**Open Ended**: We are putting very few constraints on this part but we want you to get creative.

Design a system with the Pi and anything from your kit with a focus on form, and materiality. The "stuff" that enclose the system should be informed by the desired interaction. What would a computer made of rocks be like? How would an ipod made of grass behave? Would a roomba made of gold clean your floor any differently?

**a. document the material prototype.** Include candidates that were considered even if they were set aside later.

**b. explain the selection.**
