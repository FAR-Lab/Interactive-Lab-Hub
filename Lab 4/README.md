# Ph-UI!!!

## Prep

### For lab, you will need:

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Sketches/photos of device designs
1. "Looks like" prototypes: show us what how the device should look, feel, sit, weigh, etc.
3. "Works like" prototypes: show us what the device can do
4. "Acts like" prototypes: videos/storyboards/other means of showing how a person would interact with the device
5. Submit these in the lab 4 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same for each person in the group.

## Overview


## The Report


### Part A
### Capacitive Sensing, a.k.a. Human Banana Interaction

### Part B
### OLED screen


### Part C
### Paper Display

 
**a. Document the design for your paper display.** (e.g. if you had to make it again from scratch, what information would you need?). Include interim iterations (or at least tell us about them).

Here are my initial sketches of the device design, mat layout, and final form factor:

Feedback on initial device design sketches:

Rob: Liked the first and last designs (of the top 4) its nostalgic but works for a smarthome
Irene: maybe you can do it so that the person holding the "ball" gets to play a song. It could even tell you how long they have had it (been the DJ)
Anu: she liked the 2nd of the top 4 designs, thought maybe you could stick it to the wall
Someone said it would be cool if it accepted money and allowed you to control the songs if you put money in
Ilan: could be cool if it was randomized with something like play cards to decide who picks the next song

From the feedback I decided to choose option 2 of the top 4 designs, because I felt it was important other people in the room could see the screen from a distance, but that the mat would be the best way to control it. Additionally, the jukebox looks gives it a cool nostalgic feel and enables it to also serve as a decoration piece. I also added different modes of selecting a DJ, including rotating automatically after a certain amount of time, and random selection.

Then I did the sketches of what the screens would actually look like (also pictured above)

Last I did the actual form factor of the jukebox:

I leveraged Google images for ideas on how to make it look like an old fashioned JukeBox

Here is the final paper prototype:

**b. Make a video of your paper display in action.**

**c. Explain the rationale for the design.** (e.g. Does it need to be a certain size or form or need to be able to be seen from a certain distance?)

### Part D
### Materiality

**Open Ended**: We are putting very few constraints on this part but we want you to get creative.

Design a system with the Pi and anything from your kit with a focus on form, and materiality. The "stuff" that enclose the system should be informed by the desired interaction. What would a computer made of rocks be like? How would an ipod made of grass behave? Would a roomba made of gold clean your floor any differently?

**a. document the material prototype.** Include candidates that were considered even if they were set aside later.

**b. explain the selection.**
